# Sketch

- The boundary of the region A_2 will consist of the followings.
	- The upper boundary of cap $C$
	- Horizontal segment
	- The left envelope formed by the left side of the inner hallway
	- The curve formed by the inner corner
	- The right envelope formed by the right side of the inner hallway
	- Horizontal segment

We have multiple questions to answer.
- They all form a Jordan's curve
	- I suspect this is easy.
- The region formed by the curves is something larger than the sofa itself.
	- This is not so trivial.
	- Idea: the boundary consists of an 'upper' part and the 'lower' part and the lower rays from the lower part does not cross the set $S$.
	- To execute this idea, maybe we only need to have that 
- The fact that the envelope formed by rotating lines both forms a
	- Partial convex region, and
	- its corresponding convex curve $\mathbf{x}$
	- and that the area of the partial region comes from $I(\mathbf{x})$.
	- How do I really do this????
