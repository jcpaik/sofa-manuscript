# Structure Hypothesis

Assume that a maximum sofa rotates the full $\pi/2$. This is the shape of the niche of a random sofa. As one can see, the structure resembles the niche of Gerver's sofa, in the sense that it is formed by the arch of $\mathbf{x}$, cut out in both ends by convex curves on left and right. 

First, the $\mathbf{x}(t)$ lies strictly on the right side of $\mathbf{x}(45^\circ)$ for $t > 45^\circ$ and strictly on the left side of $\mathbf{x}(45^\circ)$ for $t < 45^\circ$. The vertical lline passing through $\mathbf{x}(45^\circ)$ divides the region into two parts, each $L$ and $R$. 

Next, the sides $d(t)$ for $0 < t < 45^\circ$ forms the envelope of a convex body in the side $L$. 

Next, we prove that $\mathbf{x}(110^\circ)$ is never on the frontline of any $d(t)$. Now $\mathbf{x}(110^\circ)$ is not below $\mathbf{d}$ but $\mathbf{x}(180^\circ)$ is either on or below $\mathbf{d}$, there is some constant $110^\circ < \tau_L < 180^\circ$ such that it meets
