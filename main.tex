\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The \emph{moving sofa problem}, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, asks for the connected shape with the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$. The lower bound $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\ldots$ constructed in 1994, with 18 analytic curves and segments constituting the boundary. The upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik in 2018 using extensive computer assistance. It is conjectured that the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound, but there is no known proof. All known upper bounds on $\mu_{\max}$, including that of Kallus and Romik, are established by approximating the moving sofa with a polygonal intersection.

    We give a new approach to the moving sofa problem, interpreting it as an infinite-dimensional convex quadratic optimization problem. Consequently, we prove that any moving sofa satisfying a property named as the \emph{injectivity condition} has an area at most $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. The new conditional bound does not rely on any computer assistance, yet is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\ldots$ of Gerver than the computer-assisted upper bound $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Since Gerver's sofa $S_G$ satisfies the injectivity condition, the upper bound is effective on a domain containing the conjectured optimal sofa $S_G$. We also conjecture the \emph{injectivity hypothesis} that a maximum-area moving sofa satisfies the injectivity condition. With our result, proving the injectivity hypothesis would imply the unconditional upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\ldots$.
