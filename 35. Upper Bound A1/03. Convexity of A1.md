Here, we show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a concave function. This with [[02. Calculus of Variation on A1#^thm-maximum-presofa-a1-critical]] shows that $K_1$ attains the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$.

To do so, we find a new formula of $\mathcal{A}_1$ as the following.
> __Theorem [a1-mamikon].__ The following holds for any cap $K$. ^thm-a1-mamikon
$$
\mathcal{A}_1(K) = 
$$

_Proof._ 

Divide the path $\delta K$ into these parts.
- The line segment from $A_K^-(0)$ to $A_K^+(0)$ (the edge $e_K(0)$).
- The path $\mathbf{x}_{K, 0, \omega}$ from $A_K^+(0)$ to $A^+_K(\omega)$.
- The line segment from $A^+_K(\omega)$ to $C_K^+(0)$.
- The path $\mathbf{x}_{K, \omega, \pi/2+\omega}$ from $C_K^+(0)$ to $C_K^+(\omega)$.

Then stitch the following instances of Mamikon's theorem. Let $\mathbf{z} : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be defined as $\mathbf{z}(t) = c_K(\omega) \cap c_K(t)$ or $\mathbf{z}(\omega) = C_K^-(\omega)$. This is a absolutely continuous parametrization of line segment from $c_K(\omega) \cap c_K(0)$ to $C_K^-(\omega)$ by xx. Also, let $\tau(t)$ be the value such that $\mathbf{z}(t) = C_K^+(t) - \theta(t) u_t$.

$$
I(\mathbf{y}) - I(\mathbf{x}_{K, 0, \omega}) + I(\mathbf{y}(\omega), A_K^+(\omega)) - I(\mathbf{y}(0), A_K^+(0)) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\omega h^+_K(t)^2 \, dt
$$


$$
I(\mathbf{z}) - I(\mathbf{x}_{K, \omega, \pi/2+\omega}) + I(, ) - I(, ) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\omega} \tau(t)^2 \, dt
$$

Need to work on closed interval version of the thing as well.

- A convex map from a convex space to a vector space can be extended to the affine space to a vector space.
- Likewise, so for bilinear maps.
- For affine bilinear functionals, it is convex if and only if it is (nonnegative bilinear functional) + (linear terms)
- Let $p$ be the collection of say, functions with both left and right differentiations, bounded. Then the value exists as they are all linear.
- Affine bilinear map is always positive -> It is convex. BUT WHY?????
	- $f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \geq 0$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that the value, while being a quadratic polynomial in $\lambda$, is nonnegative. A quadratic nonnegative polynomial is always convex. Thus, this term is convex in terms of $\lambda$. And it is sufficient for convexity of whole $f$.

So a sketch would start like this.

First, we show some formula F1 for $\mathcal{A}_1$ using Mamikon.

Let's show that this is convex. 
_Proof._ Observe that F1 can be extended to a vector space $V$ naturally on any function $p$. 
Also observe that all caps embed into $V$ as a convex subset.
Thus, it is sufficient to show that F1 is convex on $V$. 

$f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \geq 0$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that the value, while being a quadratic polynomial in $\lambda$, is nonnegative. A quadratic nonnegative polynomial is always convex. Thus, this term is convex in terms of $\lambda$. And it is sufficient for convexity of whole $f$.

Remaining tasks: find the actual formula. Preferrably only using $p$.s
