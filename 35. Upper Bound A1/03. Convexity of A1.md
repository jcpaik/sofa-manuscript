# Fundamentals

- A convex map from a convex space to a vector space can be extended to the affine space to a vector space.
- Likewise, so for bilinear maps.
- For affine bilinear functionals, it is convex if and only if it is (nonnegative bilinear functional) + (linear terms)
- Let $p$ be the collection of say, functions with both left and right differentiations, bounded. Then the value exists as they are all linear.
- Affine bilinear map is always positive -> It is convex. BUT WHY?????
	- $f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \geq 0$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that the value, while being a quadratic polynomial in $\lambda$, is nonnegative. A quadratic nonnegative polynomial is always convex. Thus, this term is convex in terms of $\lambda$. And it is sufficient for convexity of whole $f$.

So a sketch would start like this.

First, we show some formula F1 for $\mathcal{A}_1$ using Mamikon.

Let's show that this is convex. 
_Proof._ Observe that F1 can be extended to a vector space $V$ naturally on any function $p$. 
Also observe that all caps embed into $V$ as a convex subset.
Thus, it is sufficient to show that F1 is convex on $V$. 

$f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \geq 0$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that the value, while being a quadratic polynomial in $\lambda$, is nonnegative. A quadratic nonnegative polynomial is always convex. Thus, this term is convex in terms of $\lambda$. And it is sufficient for convexity of whole $f$.

Remaining tasks: find the actual formula. Preferrably only using $p$.s
