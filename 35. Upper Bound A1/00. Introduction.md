The main challenge in analyzing a monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$ with a cap $K$ comes from analyzing its niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$. It is hard a priori to determine how the inner walls of the rotating hallway will contribute to the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ in a maximum monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$. For example, the niche of Hammersley's sofa consists purely of the arch formed by the inner corner. On the other hand, the niche of Gerver's sofa consists of the inner corner arch with two ends trimmed by the inner walls. Indeed, that the niche of a maximum sofa should be formed this way is what Gerver had to assume in order to derive his sofa. If the assumption is true, it would imply that Gerver's sofa attains the maximum area. However, currently we don't have a proof for the assumption.

We propose the _injectivity hypothesis_, a conjectured mathematical statement, to circumvent this assumption and obtain a finer upper bound of the sofa area. The hypothesis states that there is a monotone sofa $S$ that attains the maximum area, such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ is injective and always lies inside the parallelogram $P_\omega$.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ Assume any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [\omega_0, \pi/2]$. If the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$ has an area $\geq 22195/10000$, then the followings are true. ^thm-injectivity

> 2. If $\omega = \pi/2$, then $\mathbf{x}_K(0)$ is on the right side of $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2)$. That is, $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2) \cdot u_0 < \mathbf{x}_K(0) \cdot u_0$.

Assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we construct an effective upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ of the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$. The idea is that if the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K$ is injective, the area $I(\mathbf{x}_K)$ of the region bounded by the trajectory of $\mathbf{x}_K$ is guaranteed to be a subset of the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$. The upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is simply defined as the area of cap $K$ subtracted by the area $I(\mathbf{x}_K)$ of the region bounded by $\mathbf{x}_K$. So for example, the value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ of Hammersley's sofa matches the area of the sofa. On the other hand, the value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ of Gerver's sofa is slightly larger than the area of sofa by the region trimmed by the ends of the hallway.

We plan to provide the proof of the injectivity hypothesis using a computer-assisted approach.
`SofaDesigner`, a software capable of proving inequalities of $K$ involving a finite set of angles. 

Important TODO: introduce what `SofaDesigner` does and explain what is it capable of.
