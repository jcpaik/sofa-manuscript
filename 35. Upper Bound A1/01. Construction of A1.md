Assuming the [[04. Injectivity Theorem#^thm-injectivity|injectivity theorem]], we manage to find an effective upper bound of the area of the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}_{[0, \omega]}(K)$.

> __Definition [a1].__ For any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$, define the value $\mathcal{A}_1(K) = |K| - I(\mathbf{x}_K)$. Here, note that $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is the path of the inner corner of the rotating hallway $L_{K}(t)$. As the path is absolutely continuous, the value $I(\mathbf{x}_K)$ is well-defined. ^def-a1

> __Theorem [a1-is-upper-bound].__ For any monotone sofa $S$ with cap $K$ such that $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is an injective path in $F_\omega$, we have $|S| \leq \mathcal{A}_1(K)$. That is, $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is an upper bound of the area of sofa $S$. ^thm-a1-is-upper-bound

(Strong TODO: the epsilon argument here is quite wrong as-is. Fix that)

_Proof._ We have $|S| = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ as $S = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_{[0, \omega]}(K)$. So it is sufficient to show that $I(\mathbf{x}_K) \leq |\mathcal{N}(K)|$. Take a sufficiently small $\epsilon > 0$. We construct a Jordan curve $\Gamma$ consisting of the following paths.

- The line segment $s_R$ from the point $(-\epsilon, -\epsilon)$ to $\mathbf{x}_K(0)$
- The path $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$
- The line segment $s_L$ from $\mathbf{x}_K(\omega)$ to the point $(-\epsilon, -\epsilon)$.

The joined path $\Gamma$ formed by joining all the three paths is a Jordan curve because each path is injective, and we have the nonoverlapping line segments outside $F_\omega$ while $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ is inside $F_\omega$ for any $t \in (0, \omega)$. (TODO: why the two line segments do not overlap has a boring reason)

So by [[x2. Curves#^thm-jordan-curve]], $\Gamma$ divides the plane into an unbounded region and a bounded region. Let $\mathcal{N}_0$ be the bounded open region. First we observe that $\Gamma$ is oriented counterclockwise: take the point $p = (-\epsilon/2, -\epsilon/2)$ and consider the ray $r$ downwards from $p$, then in $\Gamma$ only the line segment $s_R$ crosses $r$ trasversely from left to right. So we have $\left| \mathcal{N}_0 \right| = I(\Gamma)$, and as $I(\Gamma) = I(s_R) + I(\mathbf{x}_K) + I(s_L) \to I(\mathbf{x}_K)$ we have $\left| \mathcal{N}_0 \right| \to I(\mathbf{x}_K)$. 

Next we show $\mathcal{N}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)$ which closes the goal as $\left| \mathcal{N}_0 \right| \leq \left| \mathcal{N}(K) \right|$. Take any $p \in \mathcal{N}_0$. Then if we think of the ray $r$ starting from $p$ upwards, then it should cross some point in the path $\Gamma$. By simple analysis we can show that the point should be in the path $\mathbf{x}_K$. Now that $p$ is strictly under some inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ of the hallway $L_K(t)$, $p$ should be in $T_K(t)$ and so in $\mathcal{N}(K)$ (TODO: assuming $p \in F_\omega$). This shows $\mathcal{N}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)$ and we're done. □

> __Definition [j].__ Define $J_\omega = [0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. ^def-j

> __Theorem [a1-formula].__ The following equation holds. ^thm-a1-formula
> $$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{A}_1(K) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{J_\omega} p_K(t) \beta_K(dt) - 
\frac{1}{2} \int_{[0, \omega]} \mathbf{x}_K(t) \times \mathbf{x}'_K(t) dt
\end{align*}
$$
> Here, note that $\mathbf{x}_K'(t)$ exists almost everywhere by [[02. Caps#^thm-inner-corner-deriv-exists-almost-everywhere]].

_Proof._ This is a combination of [[05. Area#^thm-area-with-boundary-measure]] and [[02. Curves#^def-curve-area-functional]] applied to the definition of $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$. □

> __Corollary [a1-quadratic].__ Fix arbitrary caps $K_1, K_2$. Let $K = (1-\lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$ for $\lambda \in [0, 1]$ arbitrary. Then $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is a quadratic function in terms of $\lambda$. ^cor-a1-quadratic

_Proof._ Observe that $p_K$, $\beta_K$, $\mathbf{x}_K$ are all linear in terms of $\lambda$. □
