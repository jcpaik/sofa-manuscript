Assuming the [[04. Injectivity Theorem#^thm-injectivity|injectivity theorem]], we manage to find an effective upper bound of the area of the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}_{[0, \omega]}(K)$.

> __Definition [a1].__ For any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$, define the value $\mathcal{A}_1(K) = |K| - I(\mathbf{x}_K)$. Here, note that $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is the path of the inner corner of the rotating hallway $L_{K}(t)$. As the path is absolutely continuous, the value $I(\mathbf{x}_K)$ is well-defined. ^def-a1

> __Theorem [a1-is-upper-bound].__ For any monotone sofa $S$ with cap $K$ such that $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and in $K$, we have $|S| \leq \mathcal{A}_1(K)$. That is, $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is an upper bound of the area of sofa $S$. ^thm-a1-is-upper-bound

_Proof._ We have $|S| = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ as $S = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_{[0, \omega]}(K)$. So it is sufficient to show that $I(\mathbf{x}_K) \leq |\mathcal{N}(K)|$. We construct a Jordan curve $\Gamma$ consisting of the following paths.

- The line segment from the origin $(0, 0)$ to $\mathbf{x}_K(0)$
- The path $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$
- The line segment from $\mathbf{x}_K(\omega)$ to the origin.

TODO: Fill in the required assumptions. As of now, let's assume the followings are very true.
- The formula of $\mathcal{A}_1$ (including their definitions, well-definedness)
	- Formula for cap requries sufficient development of [[05. Area]]
	- Formula for niche requires sufficient development of 
- How to take the derivative of the formula. Also requires development of each counterpart.
