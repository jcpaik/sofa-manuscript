# Motivation

epsilon-neighbor of Gerver's sofa could have terrible .

We manage to cut down the complexity of polygonal sofas by assuming no interaction of the cap $K$ and its niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. That is, the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is completely inside $K$. However, this comes at a cost of having to assume that 

Idea: show that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is strictly under the tangent lines $l_K(t)$ with uniform gap $\epsilon$.
