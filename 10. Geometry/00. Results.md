We will use the following results on a convex body of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as basic tools to approach the sofa problem. The proof of these results are irrelevant to the main discussion on sofas, so we delegate their proofs in an appendix.

# Curves

> __Definition [curve].__ (Definition 8.16) Let $\alpha : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a continuous function with $a < b$. A _curve_ $\Gamma$ _parametrized by_ $\alpha$ is the image $\Gamma$ of $\alpha$ equipped with the particular _parametrization_ $\alpha$, and we say that the curve $\Gamma$ _joins_ the points $\alpha(a)$ and $\alpha(b)$.
> If $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$ then the curve $\Gamma$ is a _closed curve_. If $\alpha(a) \neq \alpha(b)$ then the curve $\Gamma$ is an _arc_. If $\alpha$ is one-to-one then the curve $\Gamma$ is a _Jordan arc_. If $\alpha$ is one-to-one on $[a, b)$ and $\alpha(a) = \alpha(b)$ then the curve $\Gamma$ is a _Jordan curve_. ^def-curve


> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is an intersection of [[02. Geometric Primitives#^def-half-plane|half-planes]]. ^def-convex-body
