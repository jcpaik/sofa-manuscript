We will use the following results on a convex body of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as basic tools to approach the sofa problem. The proof of these results are irrelevant to the main discussion on sofas, so we delegate their proofs in an appendix.

> __Definition [curve].__ (Definition 8.16) Let $\alpha : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a continuous function with $a < b$. A _curve_ $\Gamma$ _parametrized by_ $\alpha$ is the image $\Gamma$ of $\alpha$ equipped with the particular _parametrization_ $\alpha$, and we say that the curve $\Gamma$ _joins_ the points $\alpha(a)$ and $\alpha(b)$.
> If $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$ then the curve $\Gamma$ is a _closed curve_. If $\alpha(a) \neq \alpha(b)$ then the curve $\Gamma$ is an _arc_. If $\alpha$ is one-to-one then the curve $\Gamma$ is a _Jordan arc_. If $\alpha$ is one-to-one on $[a, b)$ and $\alpha(a) = \alpha(b)$ then the curve $\Gamma$ is a _Jordan curve_. ^def-curve

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is an intersection of [[02. Geometric Primitives#^def-half-plane|half-planes]]. ^def-convex-body

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ be the line segment intersection of $K$ with the tangent line $l_K(t)$. Let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the line segment $e_K(t)$, such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned largest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned smallest in the direction of $v_t$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Theorem [mamikon].__ Let $K$ be an arbitrary convex body. Let $p, q \in \partial K$ be two different points on the boundary of $K$. Let $t_0, t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ be angles such that 
> Let $t_0, t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary angles such that $t_0 < t_1 \leq t_0 + 2\pi$. Let $\mathbf{y} : [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be some parametrization of a rectifiable curve with a measurable function $f : [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathbf{y}(t) = v_K^+(t) + f(t)v_t$ for all $t \in [t_0, t_1]$. Then the following holds. ^thm-mamikon
$$
I(\mathbf{y}) + I\left( \mathbf{y}(t_1), v_K^+(t_1) \right) - I(\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1}) + I\left( v_K^+(t_0), \mathbf{y}(t_0) \right) =  \frac{1}{2}\int_{a}^{b} f(t) ^2 \, dt
$$
