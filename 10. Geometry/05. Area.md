> __Theorem [area-with-boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, its area can be computed as the following. $$ |K| = \frac{1}{2} \int_{S^1} p_S(t) \, \beta(dt)$$ ^thm-area-with-boundary-measure

> __Theorem [variation-area].__ For two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ and its line-segment interpolation $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$ for $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, we have the following. $$\left.\frac{d}{d\lambda}\right|_{\lambda = 0} |K|
 = \int_{t \in S^1} (p_{K_2}(t) - p_{K_1}(t)) \beta_{K_1}(dt)$$ ^thm-variation-area
