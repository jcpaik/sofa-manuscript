> __Definition [winding-number].__ The _winding number_ $w(p, \mathbf{x})$ of a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \Gamma$ with respect to Jordan curve $\Gamma$ with parametrization $\mathbf{x}$ is (TODO: something). ^def-winding-number

> __Theorem [signed-area-winding-number].__ We have the following for any curve $\mathbf{x}$, even ones which might self-intersect. ^thm-signed-area-winding-number
$$
I(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} w(p, \mathbf{x}) \, dp
$$

> __Theorem [jordan-curve-winding-number].__ For any Jordan curve $\Gamma$ with parametrization $\mathbf{x}$, the winding number is zero on the unbounded component of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \Gamma$ and either +1 or -1 on the bounded component of $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \Gamma$. ^thm-jordan-curve-winding-number

> __Definition [jordan-curve-orientation].__ We say that $\Gamma$ is _oriented counterclockwise_ if $w(p, \Gamma)$ is +1 and _clockwise_ if $w(p, \Gamma)$ is -1. ^def-jordan-curve-orientation

> __Theorem [winding-number-ray].__ Let $p$ be a point inside the bounded region of the Jordan curve $\Gamma$ with parametrization $\mathbf{x}$. Let $r$ be the ray upwards in $(0, 1)$ direction starting from $p$. Let $H^L_p$ (resp. $H^R_p$) be the half-planes on the left (resp. right) side when we divide the plane by the line passing through $p$ vertically. If $\mathbf{x}(t_0) = p$ for only one $t_0 \in S^1$, and for that there exists some $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\mathbf{x}(t) \in H_p^R$ for all $t_0 - \epsilon < t < t_0$ and $\mathbf{x}(t) \in H_p^L$ for all $t_0 < t < t_0 + \epsilon$, then $\Gamma$ is oriented counterclockwise. ^thm-winding-number-ray

_Proof._ Use the lifting of $\text{arg}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus r$. â–¡

> __Theorem [area-with-boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, its area can be computed as the following. $$ |K| = \frac{1}{2} \int_{S^1} p_S(t) \, \beta(dt)$$ ^thm-area-with-boundary-measure

> __Theorem [variation-area].__ For two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ and its line-segment interpolation $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$ for $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, we have the following. $$\left.\frac{d}{d\lambda}\right|_{\lambda = 0} |K|
 = \int_{t \in S^1} (p_{K_2}(t) - p_{K_1}(t)) \beta_{K_1}(dt)$$ ^thm-variation-area
