$$

_Proof._ We need to show that the set $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ adheres to the definition of a [[#^def-cap|cap]] and that $K \supseteq S$. The containment $K \supseteq S$ comes from $S \subseteq P_{\omega}$ and $S \subseteq Q_{S}^+(t) = H_{S}(t) \cap H_{S}(t + \pi/2)$. So in particular, $K$ is nonempty. As $Q^+_S(t)$ is the intersection of two half-planes of normal angle $t$ and $t + \pi/2$, the set $K$ is a convex set supported by the set $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$. Moreover, $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ because $p_{S}(\omega)=p_S(\pi/2)=1$ as $S$ is in standard position.

The proof of $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$ is elementary but requires a bit of casework.

We first handle the case $\omega = \pi/2$. For this we only need to prove $p_{K}(3\pi/2) = 0$. As $p_{S}(\pi/2)=1$, we have some point $(x_0, 1)$ which is in $S$ and thus $K$. Observe that $(x_0, 0)$ is also in $K$ by the following argument: First, $P_{\omega} = H$ so it contains $(x_0, 0)$, and $\bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t)$ is an intersection of half-planes with normal vectors of nonnegative $y$-coordinates so it also contains $(x_{0}, 0)$ which is right below $(x_{0}, 1)$. So $(x_{0}, 0)$ is contained in $\mathcal{C}(S)$ and we have $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}(3\pi/2) \leq 0$. As $S \subseteq \mathcal{C}(S)$ we also have $p_{C(S)}(3\pi/2) \geq p_{S}(3\pi/2) = 0$ as well and so $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}(3\pi/2) = 0$.

Next we handle the case $\omega < \pi/2$. As  □

# Geometry of Caps

Let $K$ be an arbitrary cap with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and a closed _angle set_ $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq \left[ 0, \omega \right]$. We define geometric information of $K$ and

> __Theorem [cap-mixin].__ For any caps $K_1$ and $K_2$ with same rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\Theta$, the set $K = (1-\lambda)K_1 + \lambda K_2$ is also a cap. ^thm-cap-mixin

> __Theorem [cap-contains-vertex].__ If $\omega < \pi/2$, then $K$ contains the vertex $p_{\omega}$ of $P_{\omega}$. ^thm-cap-contains-vertex

> __Theorem [boundary-measure-cap].__ The boundary measure $\beta_K$ of $K$ on $S^1$  has support in $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$ and satisfies the followings. ^thm-boundary-measure-cap
$$
\int_{t \in \Theta} \cos(t) \, \beta_K(dt) = 1 \qquad \int_{t \in \Theta + \pi/2} \, \beta_K(dt) = 1

_Proof._  □

> __Theorem [cap-from-boundary-measure].__ Conversely to [[#^thm-boundary-measure-cap]], let $\beta$ be a measure on $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)$ that satisfies the following equation.  ^thm-cap-from-boundary-measure

Then the followings hold.
- If $\omega = \pi/2$, then there is a cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\Theta$ such that $\beta_K|_{\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)} = \beta$. This is unique up to horizontal translation: all the other caps $K'$ satisfying the same condition is a horizontal translation of $K$.
- If $\omega < \pi/2$, then there is a unique cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\Theta$ such that $\beta_K|_{\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)} = \beta$.
