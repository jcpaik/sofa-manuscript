A monotone sofa is _perturable_ if any epsilon perturbation of hallway positions gives a valid monotone sofa as well.

We prove that any epsilon-perturbation of maximal hallway intersections is still a maximal hallway intersection.
Then we use it to show the _balancedness_ theorem. That there exists at least one sofa of maximum area with side lengths equal to the contribution from the other sides. 
- The main reason why we need this is that it is much harder to prove things when $t$ is close to $0$ or $\omega$. Any epsilon-perturbation leads to a sudden change in derivative.
