As discussed in the introduction and [[01. Introduction/00. Introduction#^fig-monotone-sofa]], a sofa is essentially an intersection of rotating hallways. In this section, we introduce the notion of _monotonizing_ an arbitrary sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. Take any sofa $S$, and push it towards the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of the hallway $L$ during its movement so that $S$ always touches $a$ and $c$ during its movement. Also, parametrize this movement by the angle $t$ of rotation of the sofa in movement ([[01. Moving Hallway Problem#^thm-hallway-intersection-is-sofa]]; see [[15. Monotone Sofas/00. Introduction#^fig-monotone-movement]]).

Then we look at the movement in the point of view of the moving sofa. Now $S$ becomes stationary and the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ making an angle of $t$ touches $S$ in its outer walls. We define the intersection $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of rotating hallways $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$ as the _monotonization_ of $S$. We show that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also a sofa, and call such sofas of form $\mathcal{M}(S)$ as _monotone sofas_. As $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains an arbitrary sofa $S$, we can assume that the sofa with maximum area is monotone.

We define a _cap_ $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$ as a certain kind of convex body depending on $\omega$ (), and define $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ as the space of all caps $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$. The monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ with rotation angle $\omega$ then consists of two parts: the _cap_ $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ of $S$ which is a convex set of intersection of $P_\omega$ and the half-planes bounded by the outer walls of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$, and the _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ which is the union of the regions swept by the inner walls and corner of the rotating hallway. It turns out that the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ can be determined solely from the cap $K$ of the initial sofa $S$. Also, the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is guaranteed to be contained in the cap $K$. So the area of monotonization $\mathcal{M}(K)$ is $\mathcal{A}(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ which is completely determined by $K$. Thus, the problem of maximizing the sofa area becomes maximization of the area functional $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ on the space of all caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. It turns out that the space $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ is itself a convex space with convex combination $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2 \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ for any $K_1, K_2 \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ and $\lambda \in [0, 1]$. So the domain of $\mathcal{A}$ is a convex space, and although we expect $\mathcal{A}$ itself to be not convex, we use this construct a convex upper bound in the next chapter.
