As discussed in the introduction and [[01. Introduction/00. Introduction#^fig-monotone-sofa]], a sofa is essentially an intersection of rotating hallways. In this section, we introduce the notion of _monotonizing_ an arbitrary sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. Take any sofa $S$, and push it towards the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of the hallway $L$ during its movement so that $S$ always touches $a$ and $c$ during its movement ([[01. Moving Hallway Problem#^thm-hallway-intersection-is-sofa]]). We also parametrize this movement by the angle $t$ of rotation of the sofa in movement. Then, we look at the movement in the frame of the moving sofa, so that $S$ becomes stationary and the hallway rotates. We define the intersection $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of rotating hallways as the _monotonization_ of $S$, and show that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also a sofa. 

The _monotone sofa_ $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains $S$ and consists of two parts:

- The _cap_ $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ which is a convex set of intersection of $P_\omega$ and the half-planes bounded by the outer walls of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$. 
- The _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(S)$ which is the area swept by the inner corner and inner walls of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$.

The monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is the cap subtracted by the niche, and it is guaranteed that the niche is always contained inside the cap.
