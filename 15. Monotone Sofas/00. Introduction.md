As discussed in the introduction and [[01. Introduction/00. Introduction#^fig-monotone-sofa]], a sofa is essentially an intersection of rotating hallways. In this section, we introduce the notion of _monotonizing_ an arbitrary sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. Take any sofa $S$, and push it towards the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of the hallway $L$ during its movement so that $S$ always touches $a$ and $c$ during its movement ([[01. Moving Hallway Problem#^thm-hallway-intersection-is-sofa]]). Also, we parametrize this movement by the angle $t$ of rotation of the sofa in movement. Then we look at the movement in the point of view of the moving sofa. Now $S$ becomes stationary and the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ making an angle of $t$ touches $S$ in its outer walls.

We define the intersection $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of rotating hallways $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$ as the _monotonization_ of $S$. We show that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also a sofa, and call such sofas of form $\mathcal{M}(S)$ as _monotone sofas_. As $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains an arbitrary sofa $S$, we can assume that the sofa with maximum area is monotone. $\mathcal{M}(S)$ consists of two parts:

- The _cap_ $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ which is a convex set of intersection of $P_\omega$ and the half-planes bounded by the outer walls of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$. 
- The _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ which is the region swept by the inner corner and inner walls of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$. It turns out that the niche is only determined by the cap $K$.

The monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is then the cap $K$ subtracted by its niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$, and it is guaranteed that the niche is always a subset of the cap. We construct the space $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ of all caps $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$. Then as $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is completely determined by the cap $K$, the set of all monotone sofas with rotation angle $\omega$ can be seen as a subset of 

So the sofa's area is $\mathcal{A}(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$.
