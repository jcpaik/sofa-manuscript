We first rigorously show that a sofa that rotates by an angle of $\omega$ is, up to translation, an intersection of the parallelogram $P_\omega$ and hallways rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$ for any $t \in [0, \omega]$.

The first step is to translate the sofa inside the parallelogram $P_\omega$ so that it is in _standard position_ defined as the following.

> __Definition [standard-position].__ Say that a shape $S$ is in _standard position_ with respect to the _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ if the followings hold. ^def-standard-position
> 
> - $S$ is contained in the parallelogram $P_{\omega}$.
> - $p_{S}(\omega)=p_S(\pi/2)=1$. In other words, $S$ touches the sides $l(\omega, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$ of the parallelogram $P_\omega$.

We also define a _hallway intersection_ essentially as a subset of the intersection of $P_\omega$ and hallways rotated by a set of angles $\Theta$. We allow the angle set $\Theta$ to be arbitrary. We will later analyize the case where $\Theta$ is a finite set with computer assistance.

> __Definition [hallway-intersection].__ A connected shape $S$ is a _hallway intersection_ with _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and _angle set_ $\Theta \subseteq \left[ 0, \omega \right]$ if the followings hold.

> 
> - $\Theta$ is a closed set such that $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$
> - $S$ is connected.

# Tangent Hallway

For any shape $S$ in standard position, we formally define $L_S(t)$ which is the hallway rotated counterclockwise by $t$ that touches $S$ in the outer walls of the hallway.

> __Definition [tangent-rigid-motion].__ For any shape $S$ in standard position with respect to $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and an angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, define $f_S(t)$ as the rigid motion $f_S (t) = R_t \circ T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}$.  ^def-tangent-rigid-motion

_Proof._ The continuity of $f_S(t)$ comes from the continuity of the support function $p_S(t)$. □

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ in standard position with respect to $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and an angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, define the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t) = [f_S(t)](L)$ of $S$ with angle $t$. Note that $f_S(t)$ is a proper rigid transformation so it is a map from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
> Accordingly, define the _inner corner_ $\mathbf{x}_S(t) = [f_S(t)](0, 0)$ and _outer corner_ $\mathbf{y}_S(t) = [f_S(t)](1, 1)$ of the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$. ^def-tangent-hallway

We show that if any hallway rotated counterclockwise by $t$ contains $S$, then the pushed hallway $L_S(t)$ also contains $S$.

> __Lemma [in-tangent-hallway].__ If a shape $S$ in standard position with respect to $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$ for an angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, then the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ contains $S$ as well. ^lem-in-tangent-hallway

_Proof._ As $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$, the set $S' = [f_S(t)]^{-1}(S)$ is contained in a translation of $[f_S(t)]^{-1}(R_t(L)) = T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(L)$ and thus a translation of $L$. We will show that $S'$ is contained in $L$. This proves the goal as $S' \subseteq L$ implies the following. 
$$S = [f_{S}(t)](S') \subseteq [f_S(t)](L)=L_S(t)$$
To show $S' \subseteq L$, we first compute $p_{S'}(0) = 1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2)=1$. For any $u \in S^1$ we have the computation
$$p_{S}(u) = p_{[f_S(t)](S')}(u) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(u-t)$$
so by letting $u=t$, we have $p_S(t) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(0)=p_{S'}(0)+p_S(t)-1$ and by letting $u=t+\pi/2$, we have $p_S(t + \pi/2) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(\pi/2)=p_{S'}(\pi/2)+p_S(t + \pi/2)-1$. That is, by evaluation we have $p_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$.
Now we show $S' \subseteq L$. By assumption we have $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$ for some vector $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. By comparing their support functions at $t=0, \pi/2$ we have $1=p_{S'}(0) \leq p_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(0) = 1 + x_{0}$ and $1=p_{S'}(\pi/2) \leq p_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(\pi/2) = 1 + y_0$ so we have $0 \leq x_0, y_0$. The set $(-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$ is disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. Using $0 \leq x_0, y_0$ on the disjointness, we have that $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0) \subseteq (-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$ is also disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. So the set $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$ is disjoint from $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$. Also, $S' \subseteq (-\infty, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ because $p_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$. Thus, $S' \subseteq L = (-\infty, 1] \times (-\infty, 1] \setminus (-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$. □

%% TODO: elaborate more on the remark above %%

Finally, we show that a sofa is a hallway intersection with the angle set $[0, \omega]$ up to rigid transformation.

> __Theorem [sofa-iff-hallway-intersection].__ A shape $S$ is a sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ if and only if $S$ is connected and there is a proper rigid transformation $g$ such that $g(S)$ is a hallway intersection with the angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$. Moreover, any hallway intersection $S$ with the angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$ admits the sofa movement $f_S(t)$ inside $L$ with its corresponding hallway $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$. ^thm-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection

_Proof._ ($\Rightarrow$) Assume that $S$ is a sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. We will prove that there is a proper rigid transformation $g$ such that $g(S)$ is a hallway intersection with angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$. First of all, note that any rigid transformation of $S$ is also a sofa, so we can replace $S$ with its rigid transformation without loss of generality. Let $f_- : [a, b] \to \mathcal{T}$ be the movement of the sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ (see [[00. Sofa#^def-sofa]] and [[00. Sofa#^def-rotation-angle]]). By replacing $S$ with $f_a(S)$ and $f_t$ with $f_t \circ f_a^{-1}$, we can assume without loss of generality that $f_a(S) = S$ (that is, we can assume that $S$ starts its movement at its own position). Consequently, we get that $f_b$ is a proper rigid transformation with rotation angle $-\omega$. 

We will show that a translation of $S$ is in $P_\beta = H \cap R_{\omega} (V)$. By the definition of sofa movement [[00. Sofa#^def-sofa]], $S = f_a(S)$ lies in $H$. Also, $f_b(S) \subseteq V$ so $S \subseteq f_b^{-1}(V)$. As $f_b^{-1}$ has rotation angle $-\omega$, $f_b^{-1}(V)$ is a translation of $R_\omega(V)$. So $S$ also lies inside a translation of $R_\omega(V)$. Thus, a translation of $S$ lies in $P_\beta = H \cap R_\omega(V)$. By translating the $S$ inside $P_\beta$ towards the edges $l(\beta, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$, we can find a translation of $S$ inside $P_{\beta}$ that also touches the edges $l(\beta, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$. Without loss of generality, replace $S$ with this translation. Then we can assume $S$ is contained in the horizontal strip $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$, and that $p_{S}(\omega)=p_S(\pi/2)=1$. This proves the second and fourth condition for [[#^def-hallway-intersection]].

As $f_a$ is identity transformation and $f_b$ is a proper rigid transformation with rotation angle $-\omega$, by intermediate value theorem on the rotation angle we can always find some time $t$ where the transformation $f_t$ has rotation angle $-\theta$ for any $\theta \in [0, \omega]$. Then $f_t(S)$ contained in $L$ by the definition of sofa, and so $S$ is contained in $f^{-1}_{t}(L)$ which is the hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\theta$ for any $\theta \in [0, \omega]$. This proves the third condition for [[#^def-hallway-intersection]], ending the proof.

( $\Leftarrow$) Assume that $S$ is a hallway intersection with angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$. We will show that $S$ is a sofa with rotation angle $\omega$. By [[#^lem-in-tangent-hallway]] we have $L_S(t) = [f_S(t)](L)$ always containing $S$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$. So $[f_S(t)^{-1}](S)$ is always contained in $L$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$. As $f_S(t)^{-1}$ is is a rigid motion respect to $t$ by [[#^def-tangent-rigid-motion]], it remains for us to show that $[f_S(0)^{-1}](S)$ is contained in $H$ and $[f_S(\omega)^{-1}](S)$ is contained in $R_{\omega}(V)$. As $p_{S}(\omega)=p_S(\pi/2)=1$, the map $f_{S}(0)$ is a horizontal translation, so $[f_S(0)^{-1}](S)$ is contained in $H$ as $S \subseteq H$. Likewise, $f_{S}(\omega)^{-1}$ is a clockwise rotation of $\omega$ followed by vertical translation. As $S \subseteq R_\omega(V)$, this implies that $[f_S(\omega)^{-1}](S)$ is contained in $R_{\omega}(V)$. This finishes the proof. □
