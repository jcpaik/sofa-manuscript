We observed that a sofa is essentially the intersection of rotating sofas in the introduction. Let us now examine this idea in full details.

Let $S$ be a sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and the movement described by the rigid transformation $f_t$ with time $t \in [a, b]$. So the sofa $S$ in movement at time $t$ is positioned at $S_t = f_t(S)$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the sofa $S = S_a$ is equal to its initial position of the movement. So $f_a$ is the identity map on $\mathbb{R}^2$.

In perspective of the sofa, $S$ is always contained in the rotating hallway $L_t = f_t^{-1}(S)$ for any time $t \in [a, b]$. Now note that the initial hallway $L_a$ is a translation of $L$ and the final $L_b$ is a translation of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$. By the intermediate value theorem on the roation angle of $L_t$ for $a \leq t \leq b$, a sofa $S$ is always contained in some hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\theta$ for any $\theta \in [0, \omega]$. We have observed this in the introduction. 

What we have omitted in this observation up to now is that the sofa $S$ is also contained in two strips of width 1. The initial sofa $S = S_a$ should be in $H$. The final sofa $S_b = f_b(S)$ should be in $H$, so $S$ is also contained in $f_b^{-1}(H)$ which is the vertical strip rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$. Thus, a sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ is contained in hallways rotated by any angle in $[0, \omega]$, and translations of strips $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$ (refer to [[00. Sofa#^def-rigid-motion]] for the definition of $R_\omega$). This is the exact formalization of the idea that a sofa is the intersection of rotating hallways.

We will generalize this concept of intersection of rotating hallways to an arbitrary set $\Theta$ of angles.

> __Definition [hallway-intersection].__ A shape $S$ is a _hallway intersection_ with _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and _angle set_ $\Theta \subseteq \left[ 0, \omega \right]$ if the followings hold.

By the discussion above, any sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \omega]$ can be translated and rotated to a hallway intersection with the angle set $[0, \omega]$. We introduce this generalization because we later will approximate $S$ by a polygonal hallway intersection with a finite angle set.

Any hallway intersection $S$ with rotation angle $\omega$ is in translations of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$. By translating $S$, we can assume that this intersection $P$ is the parallelogram $P_\omega$ defined as the following.

> __Definition [parallelogram].__ For any angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the _parallelogram_ $P_\omega = H \cap R_\omega(V)$ as the intersection of the horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, and the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$ centered at the origin. For any $\omega \in [0, \pi/2)$ let $p_{\omega} = l(\omega, 1) \cap l(\pi/2, 1)$ be the upper-right corner of the parallelogram. ^def-parallelogram

Note that $P_\omega$ is a proper parallelogram if $\omega < \pi/2$, and the horizontal strip $H$ if $\omega = \pi/2$. Let us push $S$ towards the upper edges $l(\omega, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$ inside $P_\omega$. This puts $S$ in _standard position_ defined as the following.

> - $p_{S}(\omega)=p_S(\pi/2)=1$. In other words, $S$ touches the sides $l(\omega, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$ of the parallelogram $P_\omega$.

> __Corollary [sofa-is-hallway-intersection].__ Let $S$ be any sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. Then there is a rigid transformation $f$ such that $f(S)$ is a hallway intersection in standard position with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $[0, \omega]$. ^cor-sofa-is-hallway-intersection

_Proof._ From the discussion above. □

From now on, assume an arbitrary hallway intersection $S$ in standard position with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$ (it helps to imagine $S$ as just a sofa in standard position, and that $\Theta = [0, \omega]$). 

For any angle $t \in \Theta$, the set $S$ is contained in some hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclcokwise by $t$. We restrict the position of $L_t$ by pushing the outer walls of $L_t$ towards $S$ as much as we can. The result is a _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t)$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ that still contains $S$ and touches $S$ in its two outer sides.

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the rigid transformation $f_S(t)$ as the map $f_S (t) = R_t \circ T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}$. Define the _tangent hallway_ of $S$ with angle $t$ as the hallway $L_S(t) = [f_S(t)](L)$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$. ^def-tangent-hallway

The map $f_S$ is constructed so that it sends the standard hallway $L$ with $p_L(0) = p_L(\pi/2) = 1$ to the hallway $L' = L_S(t)$ with $p_{L'}(t) = p_{S}(t)$ and $p_{L'}(t + \pi/2) = p_{S}(t + \pi/2)$. That is, $L_S(t)$ always touches $S$ in its outer walls.
Here, we give names to the sides and corners of $L_S(t)$.

> __Definition [hallway-parts].__ Let $a, b, c, d$ be the sides of $L$ described by the equations $x=1$, $x=0$, $y=1$, $y=0$ respectively. So $a$ and $c$ are outer sides of $L$, and $b$ and $d$ are inner sides of $L$. Let $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ be the inner and outer corner of $L$ respectively. Let $Q^+ = (-\infty, 1]^2$ be the closed quarter-plane bounded by $a$ and $c$. Let $Q^- = (-\infty, 0)^2$ be the open quarter-plane bounded by $b$ and $d$, so that $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$. ^def-hallway-parts

> For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let $a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t), d_S(t), \mathbf{x}_S(t), \mathbf{y}_S(t)$ be the parts of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the parts $a, b, c, d, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, Q^+, Q^-$ of $L$ respectively. For example, $b_S(t) = f_S(b)$.

We include a rigorous proof that for hallway intersection $S$, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ always contains $S$ and touches $S$ on the outer 

# Tangent Hallways

For any shape $S$ in standard position, we formally define $L_S(t)$ which is the hallway rotated counterclockwise by $t$ that touches $S$ in the outer walls of the hallway.

> __Definition [tangent-rigid-motion].__ For any shape $S$ in standard position with respect to $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and an angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, define $f_S(t)$ as the rigid motion $f_S (t) = R_t \circ T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}$.  ^def-tangent-rigid-motion

_Proof._ The continuity of $f_S(t)$ comes from the continuity of the support function $p_S(t)$. □



We show that if any hallway rotated counterclockwise by $t$ contains $S$, then the pushed hallway $L_S(t)$ also contains $S$.

> __Lemma [in-tangent-hallway].__ If a shape $S$ in standard position with respect to $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$ for an angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, then the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ contains $S$ as well. ^lem-in-tangent-hallway

_Proof._ As $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$, the set $S' = [f_S(t)]^{-1}(S)$ is contained in a translation of $[f_S(t)]^{-1}(R_t(L)) = T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(L)$ and thus a translation of $L$. We will show that $S'$ is contained in $L$. This proves the goal as $S' \subseteq L$ implies the following. 
$$S = [f_{S}(t)](S') \subseteq [f_S(t)](L)=L_S(t)$$
To show $S' \subseteq L$, we first compute $p_{S'}(0) = 1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2)=1$. For any $u \in S^1$ we have the computation
$$p_{S}(u) = p_{[f_S(t)](S')}(u) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(u-t)$$
so by letting $u=t$, we have $p_S(t) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(0)=p_{S'}(0)+p_S(t)-1$ and by letting $u=t+\pi/2$, we have $p_S(t + \pi/2) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(\pi/2)=p_{S'}(\pi/2)+p_S(t + \pi/2)-1$. That is, by evaluation we have $p_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$.
Now we show $S' \subseteq L$. By assumption we have $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$ for some vector $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. By comparing their support functions at $t=0, \pi/2$ we have $1=p_{S'}(0) \leq p_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(0) = 1 + x_{0}$ and $1=p_{S'}(\pi/2) \leq p_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(\pi/2) = 1 + y_0$ so we have $0 \leq x_0, y_0$. The set $(-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$ is disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. Using $0 \leq x_0, y_0$ on the disjointness, we have that $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0) \subseteq (-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$ is also disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. So the set $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$ is disjoint from $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$. Also, $S' \subseteq (-\infty, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ because $p_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$. Thus, $S' \subseteq L = (-\infty, 1] \times (-\infty, 1] \setminus (-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$. □

> __Remark [in-tangent-hallway].__ [[#^lem-in-tangent-hallway]] is possible because the inner corner of the hallway has an angle of exactly 90 degrees. ^rem-in-tangent-hallway

%% TODO: elaborate more on the remark above %%

Finally, we observe that any hallway intersection $S$ with angle set $[0, \omega]$ is actually a sofa. That is, it has the continuous movement $f_S$.
