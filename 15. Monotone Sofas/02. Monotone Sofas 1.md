$$
\mathcal{C}(S) = P_{\omega} \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t) 
$$

_Proof._ We need to show that the set $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ adheres to the definition of a [[#^def-cap|cap]] and that $K \supseteq S$. The containment $K \supseteq S$ comes from $S \subseteq P_{\omega}$ and $S \subseteq Q_{S}^+(t) = H_{S}(t) \cap H_{S}(t + \pi/2)$. So in particular, $K$ is nonempty. As $Q^+_S(t)$ is the intersection of two half-planes of normal angle $t$ and $t + \pi/2$, the set $K$ is a convex set supported by the set $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$. Moreover, $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ because $p_{S}(\omega)=p_S(\pi/2)=1$ as $S$ is in standard position.

The proof of $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$ is elementary but requires a bit of casework.

We first handle the case $\omega = \pi/2$. For this we only need to prove $p_{K}(3\pi/2) = 0$. As $p_{S}(\pi/2)=1$, we have some point $(x_0, 1)$ which is in $S$ and thus $K$. Observe that $(x_0, 0)$ is also in $K$ by the following argument: First, $P_{\omega} = H$ so it contains $(x_0, 0)$, and $\bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t)$ is an intersection of half-planes with normal vectors of nonnegative $y$-coordinates so it also contains $(x_{0}, 0)$ which is right below $(x_{0}, 1)$. So $(x_{0}, 0)$ is contained in $\mathcal{C}(S)$ and we have $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}(3\pi/2) \leq 0$. As $S \subseteq \mathcal{C}(S)$ we also have $p_{C(S)}(3\pi/2) \geq p_{S}(3\pi/2) = 0$ as well and so $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}(3\pi/2) = 0$.

Next we handle the case $\omega < \pi/2$. As  □

> __Definition [niche-monotonization-hallway-intersection].__ For any shape $S$ in standard position with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the _niche_ of a hallway intersection $S$ as the following set. ^def-niche-hallway-intersection
$$
\mathcal{N}(S) = P_{\omega} \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_S(t) 
$$
> Also, define the _monotonization_ of $S$ as the set $\mathcal{M}(S) = \mathcal{C}(S) \setminus \mathcal{N}(S)$. 

> __Theorem [monotonization-is-hallway-intersection].__ The monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is a hallway intersection that contains $S$. ^thm-monotonization-is-hallway-intersection

_Proof._ The containment $\mathcal{M}(S) \supseteq S$ come from the following.
$$
\mathcal{M}(S) = \mathcal{C}(S) \setminus \mathcal{N}(S) = P_\omega \cap \left( \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t) \setminus \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_S(t) \right) = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_S(t) \supseteq S
$$
Here the last containment holds from [[01. Moving Hallway Problem#^lem-in-tangent-hallway]]. This is also a hallway intersection because $P_{\omega} \supseteq \mathcal{M}(S) \supseteq S$ and $\mathcal{M}(S)$ admits the same sofa movement as $S$ did in [[01. Moving Hallway Problem#^thm-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]]. □
