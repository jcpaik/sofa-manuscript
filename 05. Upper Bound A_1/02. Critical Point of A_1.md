Now let's do some calculation to find when is the variation $\left.\frac{d}{d\lambda}\right|_{\lambda=0} \mathcal{A}_{0}(K)=0$.
The condition was that $\beta_{K}(dt) = f_{K}(t)dt$. $f_{K}(t)$ was defined as:

> __Definition [def_f]__ $f_{K}(t) = h_{K}(t) - 1$ and $f_{K}(t+ \frac{\pi}{2}) = g_{K}(t) - 1$ for $t \in [0, \beta]$. 

Here is a calculation. Assume $\beta_K(dt) = f_K(t)dt$ for $f$ differentiable on the interior of $\Gamma_\beta$. Then it turns out that $g_K(t)$ and $h_K(t)$ are differentiable for $t \in (0, \beta)$. This is a calculation. Note that $\beta(du)$ is zero when $u$ is outside $\Gamma_\beta$, and it can be possible that $\beta(du)$ has point mass on the values $u = \beta, \pi/2$.
$$
\begin{align}
g_K'(t) & = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0} \int_{t}^{t+\pi/2} \cos \left( u - t \right) \, \beta(du) \\
& = -f_K(t) + \int_t^{t+\pi/2} \sin (u-t)\, \beta(du) = -f_K(t) + h_K(t) 
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
h_K'(t) & = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0} \int_{t}^{t+\pi/2} \sin \left( u - t \right) \, \beta(du) \\
& = f_K\left( t + \pi/2 \right) - \int_t^{t+\pi/2} \cos (u-t)\, \beta(du) = f_K(t + \pi/2) - g_K(t)
\end{align}
$$
By using Definition [def_f], we obtain the following equations for $t \in (0, \beta)$.
$$
\begin{gather}
g'_K(t) = -h_K(t) + 1 + h_K(t) = 1 \\
h'_K(t) = g_K(t) - 1 - g_K(t) = -1
\end{gather}
$$
The boundary conditions is that we need the ledge heights to be equal to $g_K(0)=1$ and $h(\beta)=1$. So this gives formula $g_K(t) = 1 + t$ and $h_K(t) = 1 + (\beta-t)$. So $f_K(t) = (\beta-t)$ and $f_K(t+\pi/2) = t$.
As the height of the sofa has to be equal to 1, we have the following.
$$
\int_{t \in [0, \beta] } \cos \left( t \right) \, \beta_K (dt) = 1
$$
Computation then gives the following.
$$
\int_{t \in [0, \beta]} \cos (t) (\beta-t) \, dt + \beta_K(\{\beta\}) = 1 - \cos (b) + \beta_K(\left\{ \beta \right\}) = 1
$$
So consequently $\beta_K(\{\beta\}) = \cos(b)$. By symmetry it is also that $\beta_K(\{\pi/2\}) = \cos(b)$ as well.

> __Definition [maximum-presofa-a0].__ For any rotation angle $\beta \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the cap $K_0$ as the cap with boundary measure described by 
> $$
\begin{gather}
\beta_K(\{\beta\}) = \cos(b) \\
\beta_K(\{\pi/2\}) = \cos(b) \\
\beta_{K}(dt) = f_{K}(t)dt \\
f_K(t) = (\beta-t) \text{ and } f_K(t+\pi/2) = t \text{ for } t \in (0, \beta)
\end{gather}
$$

> __Theorem [maximum-presofa-a0-critical].__ For any cap $K'$ and $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, if we let $K = (1-\lambda) K_0 + \lambda K'$ then $\left.\frac{d}{d\lambda}\right| \mathcal{A}_0(K) = 0$.
