> __Definition [a1].__ For any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$, define the value $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ as the following. ^def-a1
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{A}_0(K) & = |K| - |\mathcal{N}_0(K)| \\ 
& = \frac{1}{2} \int_{t \in \Gamma_\beta} p_K(t) \beta_K(dt)
- \frac{1}{2} \int_{t \in [0, \beta]} \mathbf{x}_K(t) \times \mathbf{x}'_K(t) dt
\end{align*}

_Proof._  â–¡

TODO: Fill in the required assumptions. As of now, let's assume the followings are very true.
- The formula of $\mathcal{A}_1$ (including their definitions, well-definedness)
	- Formula for cap requries sufficient development of [[03. Area]]
	- Formula for niche requires sufficient development of [[01. Statement]]
- How to take the derivative of the formula. Also requires development of each counterpart.
