In Section 4 [@romik], Romik gives a streamlined derivation of Gerver's sofa $G$. In this [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface]], extract the properties of $G$ from his derivation that will be needed in the next [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/15. Quadratic Upper Bound/00. Preface]].

Gerver's sofa $G$ is a monotone sofa with the boundary parametrized by five oriented curves $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}$, and $\mathbf{x}$ (see [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^fig-gerver-curves]]). In Romik's derivation, the five curves are determined by a finite number of parameters, that satisfy the system of Equations 27 to 44 in [@romik]. By solving the system of equations with `Mathematica`, he determines the five curves $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}, \mathbf{x}$. and thus $G$ completely.

The five curves are parametrized differently in each of the five intervals $I_1, \dots, I_5$ in the following [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-intervals]].

> __Definition [gerver-constants].__ Define $\varphi$ and $\theta$ as the real constants satisfying $0 < \varphi < \theta < \pi/4$ and Equation 27 to 44 of [@romik]. Note that $\varphi \in [0.039, 0.040]$ in particular (see Table 1 of [@romik]). ^def-gerver-constants

> __Definition [gerver-intervals].__ Define ^def-gerver-intervals
$$
(t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5) := (0, \varphi, \theta, \pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2 - \varphi, \pi/2)
$$
> so that $t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_5$ forms a partition of the interval $[0, \pi/2]$. For all $1 \leq i \leq 5$, define the interval $I_i := [t_{i-1}, t_i)$.

> __Definition [gerver-x].__ Define $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the continuously differentiable function satisfying Equation 25 to 44 of [@romik] as solved in Section 4 of [@romik]. In particular, by Equation 25 of [@romik], for every $1 \leq i \leq 5$ the restriction $\mathbf{x}_i := \mathbf{x}|_{\overline{I_i}}$ at $i$'th interval satisfies the $i$'th ODE in Theorem 2 of [@romik]. ^def-gerver-x

> __Definition [gerver-abcd].__ Define the curves $\mathbf{A} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbf{B} : [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbf{C} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, and $\mathbf{D} : [0, \theta] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ determined by $\mathbf{x}$ in [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-x]] according to Equation (9)-(12) of [@romik] respectively. ^def-gerver-abcd

The boundary of $G$ is traced out by the following five curves (see Figure XX).

> __Theorem [gerver-monotone].__ Gerver's sofa $G$ is a monotone sofa. Let $K := \mathcal{C}(G)$ be the cap of $G$. Then the followings are true. ^thm-gerver-monotone
> 
> 1. The cap $K$ have vertices $A_K(t) = \mathbf{A}(t)$ and $C_K(t) = \mathbf{C}(t)$.
> 2. We have the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K(t) = \mathbf{x}(t)$.
> 3. The niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the region enclosed by the counterclockwise Jordan curve which is the concatenation of the following curves in order. 
> 	1. The curve $\mathbf{D} : [0, \theta] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. 
> 	2. The curve $\mathbf{x}$ restricted to $[\varphi, \pi/2 - \varphi] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and reversed in time.
> 	3. The curve $\mathbf{B} : [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$.
> 	4. The horizontal line from $\mathbf{B}(\pi/2)$ to $\mathbf{D}(0)$.

We do not prove [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^thm-gerver-monotone]] rigorously. However, experts agree that this is the right shape of Gerver's sofa.

The following [[#^pro-c]] translates the curves $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}, \mathbf{x}$ used by [@romik] to our language of caps $K$. Note that for each equation in [[#^pro-c]], the left-hand side is the [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-x]] and [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-abcd]] from [@romik], and the right-hand side is the notions on $K$ defined in this paper.

> __Proposition [c].__ Let $K := \mathcal{C}(G)$ be the cap of Gerver's sofa $G$. Then the followings hold. ^pro-c
> 
> 1. $\mu_t = u_t$ and $\nu_t = v_t$.
> 2. $\mathbf{A}(t) = A_K(t)$ and $\mathbf{C}(t) = C_K(t)$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 3. $\mathbf{A}'(t) = r_K(t) v_t$ and $\mathbf{C}'(t) = -s_K(t)u_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 4. $\mathbf{B}(t) = A_K(t) - u_t$ for $t \in [0, \theta]$, and $\mathbf{D}(t) = C_K(t) - v_t$ for $t \in [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2]$.
> 5. $\mathbf{B}'(t) = - (1 - r_K(t)) v_t$ for $t \in [0, \theta]$, and $\mathbf{D}'(t) = (1 - s_K(t))u_t$ for $t \in [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2]$.
> 6. $\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 7. $\mathbf{x}'(t) = -(f_K(t) - 1) u_t + (g_K(t) - 1) v_t$

_Proof._ (1), (2), (6) have same definitions with different notations in [@romik] and this paper. (7) comes from (6) and [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/05. Arm Lengths#^thm-inner-corner-deriv]]. □

The following [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^thm-g]] is transferring the local optimality conditions computed by Gerver and Romik in our language.

> __Theorem [g].__ For the cap $K := \mathcal{C}(G)$ of Gerver's sofa $G$, the followings are all true. ^thm-g
> 
> 1. For all $t \in I_1$, we have $r_K(t) = 0$ and $s_K(t) = 1 - s_K(t)$.
> 2. For all $t \in I_2$, we have $r_K(t) = 1 - g_K(t)$ and.

_Proof._ Convert the Equations (17)-(22) on $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}, \mathbf{x}$ in [@romik] to our notations using [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^pro-c]]. The following table.

[^symm]: [@romik] omits exact equations for the interval $I_5$ as the cases $I_1$ and $I_5$ are symmetric to each other.

[^not-proven]: To be precise, this is an assumption made to derive Gerver's sofa $G$, but is not verified rigorously by plugging $G$ back in. See Remark XX.
