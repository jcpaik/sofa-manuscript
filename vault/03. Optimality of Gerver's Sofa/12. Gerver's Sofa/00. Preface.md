Recall that Gerver's sofa $G$ is derived by assuming five stages of movement, each consisting of contact sets. 
This is the table of contact sets.

In the first stage, at the end of the statement of Theorem 2 of [@romik], Romik notes that $\mathbf{A}'(t)$ in $I_1$ and $\mathbf{C}'(t)$ in $I_5$. This with (3) of [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^pro-c]] shows XX and YY.
