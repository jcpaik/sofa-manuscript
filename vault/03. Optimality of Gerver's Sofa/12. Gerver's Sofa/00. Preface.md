In this [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface]], we gather enough information on Gerver's sofa $G$ from the derivation of $G$ by Romik in Section 4 of [@romik]. In his derivation, the boundary of $G$ is parametrized by five curves $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D}$, and $\mathbf{x}$ (see XX). The five curves are determined by parameters satisfying a system of equations. By solving the system of Equations 27 to 44 in [@romik], he determines the five curves and thus $G$.



> __Definition [gerver-constants].__ Define $\varphi$ and $\theta$ as the real constants satisfying $0 < \varphi < \theta < \pi/4$ and Equation 27 to 44 of [@romik]. Note that $\varphi \in [0.039, 0.040]$ in particular (see Table 1 of [@romik]). ^def-gerver-constants

> __Remark [gerver-constants].__ Table 1 of [@romik] computes $\varphi$ and $\theta$ up to 18 digits. Romik reports that mroe digits can be computed 'immediately', but there is likely no closed-form presentations of $\varphi$ and $\theta$. ^rem-gerver-constants

The movement of $G$ in hallway $L$ comprises of five different stages, each parametrized by five intervals $t \in \overline{I_i}$ over index $1 \leq i \leq 5$ defined as the following.

> __Definition [gerver-intervals].__ Define ^def-gerver-intervals
$$
(t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5) := (0, \varphi, \theta, \pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2 - \varphi, \pi/2)
$$
> so that $t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_5$ forms a partition of the interval $[0, \pi/2]$. For all $1 \leq i \leq 5$, define the interval $I_i := [t_{i-1}, t_i)$.

> __Definition [gerver-x].__ Define $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the continuously differentiable function satisfying Equation 25 to 44 of [@romik], as described in Section 4 of [@romik]. In particular, by Equation 25 of [@romik], for every $1 \leq i \leq 5$ the restriction $\mathbf{x}_i := \mathbf{x}|_{I_i}$ satisfies the $i$'th ODE in Theorem 2 of [@romik]. ^def-gerver-x

> __Definition [gerver-abcd].__ Define the curves $\mathbf{A} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbf{B} : [0, \theta] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbf{C} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, and $\mathbf{D} : [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ determined by $\mathbf{x}$ in [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-x]] according to Equation (9)-(12) of [@romik] respectively. ^def-gerver-abcd

The boundary of $G$ is traced out by the following five curves (see Figure XX).

> __Theorem [gerver-monotone].__ Gerver's sofa $G$ is a monotone sofa. Let $K := \mathcal{C}(G)$ be the cap of $G$. Then the cap $K$ is in $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i}$, have vertices $A_K(t) = \mathbf{A}(t)$ and $C_K(t) = \mathbf{C}(t)$.  The niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ consists of  ^thm-gerver-monotone

The following [[#^pro-c]] is used to translate the solution in [@romik] to our language of caps. Note that for each equation in [[#^pro-c]], the left-hand side is the [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-x]] and [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/12. Gerver's Sofa/00. Preface#^def-gerver-abcd]] from [@romik], and the right-hand side is the notions on $K$ defined in this paper.

> __Proposition [c].__ Let $K := \mathcal{C}(G)$ be the cap of Gerver's sofa $G$. Then the followings hold. ^pro-c

> 2. $\mathbf{A}(t) = A_K(t)$ and $\mathbf{C}(t) = C_K(t)$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 3. $\mathbf{A}'(t) = r_K(t) v_t$ and $\mathbf{C}'(t) = -s_K(t)u_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 4. $\mathbf{B}(t) = A_K(t) - u_t$ for $t \in [0, \theta]$, and $\mathbf{D}(t) = C_K(t) - v_t$ for $t \in [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2]$.
> 5. $\mathbf{B}'(t) = - (1 - r_K(t)) v_t$ for $t \in [0, \theta]$, and $\mathbf{D}'(t) = (1 - s_K(t))u_t$ for $t \in [\pi/2 - \theta, \pi/2]$.
> 6. $\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 7. $\mathbf{x}'(t) = -(f_K(t) - 1) u_t + (g_K(t) - 1) v_t$

_Proof._ (1), (2), (6) have same definitions with different notations in [@romik] and this paper.

For (3), 

(7) comes from (6) and [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/05. Arm Lengths#^thm-inner-corner-deriv]].
