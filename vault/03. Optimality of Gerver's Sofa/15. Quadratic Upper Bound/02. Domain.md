We first define a convex subset $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i}$ of caps $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$ that satisfy the injectivity condition. find both balanced maximum caps and the cap $\mathcal{C}(G)$ of Gerver's sofa $G$.

> __Definition [cap-space-special].__ Define $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i}$ as the subset of caps $K \in \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$ that (i) satisfies the injectivity condition ([[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^def-injectivity-condition]]), and have area $|K| \geq 2.2$. ^def-cap-space-special

- Say that you can talk about $f_K$ and $g_K$ and $A_K$ and $C_K$.
- Build density functions $r_K$ and $s_K$ on $[0, \pi/2]$. 

> __Theorem [cap-space-special].__ The space $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i}$ is a convex subspace of $\mathcal{K}$ containing all balanced maximum caps $K \in \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$ and the cap $\mathcal{C}(G)$ of Gerver's sofa. ^thm-cap-space-special

_Proof._ We first show that $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i} \subset \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$ is a convex subset. The [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^def-injectivity-condition]] of injectivity condition on $K$ is made of linear constraints in $K$, and so is preserved under the barycentric operation of $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$. For any $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, by the Brunn-Minkowski theorem
$$
|(1 - \lambda)K_1 + \lambda K_2| \geq |K_1|^{1 - \lambda} |K_2|^{\lambda}
$$
we have $|c_\lambda(K_1, K_2)| \geq 2.2$ if $|K_1|, |K_2| \geq 2.2$. This shows that the condition $|K| \geq 2.2$ is also closed under $c_\lambda$. So $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i}$ defines a convex subset of $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$.

By [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]] and [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity-gerver]], both the balanced maximum caps $K$ and the cap $\mathcal{C}(G)$ of Gerver's sofa satisfy the injectivity condition. It is known that $G$ have area $2.2195\dots \geq 2.2$, and any balanced maximum cap $K$ attains the maximum value of sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}(K)$, so it should have area $|K| \geq \mathcal{A}(K) \geq \mathcal{A}(G) = 2.2195\dots \geq 2.2$ again. â–¡
