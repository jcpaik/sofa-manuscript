Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway-ch3].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = H_L \cup V_L$ of its _horizontal side_ $H_L = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $V_L = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway-ch3

> __Definition [moving-sofa-ch3].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation-ch3] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed-ch3] subset of $H_L$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $V_L$. ^def-moving-sofa-ch3

The best bounds known so far on the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \alpha_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[#^fig-gerver-ch3]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

In this paper, we prove that Gerver's sofa indeed achieves the maximum area, resolving the problem completely.

> __Theorem [the-main].__ Gerver's sofa $G$ attains the maximum area of a moving sofa. ^thm-the-main

The key difficulty in establishing [[03. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-the-main]] is that there are many possible kinds of the shape of a moving sofa $S$, so that there is no single formula of the area that works for all shape. TODO: write more introductory ideas.

The main idea is to give an upper bound $\mathcal{Q}$ of the area of a moving sofa.
that is quadratic and concave on a convex domain. The domain of $\mathcal{Q}$ is a collection of planar convex bodies with the barycentric operation given by Minkowski sums. We extend the Brunn-Minkowski theory on planar convex bodies to define $\mathcal{Q}$ and calculate its directional derivative. Gerver's sofa is then a critical point of $\mathcal{Q}$ and thus a global optimum of $\mathcal{Q}$. Since the value of $\mathcal{Q}$ on Gerver's sofa is equal to the area, this proves the optimality.

[^sofa-translation-ch3]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate it at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]]eface#^fig-gerver]]]).

[^sofa-closed-ch3]: Taking the closure of a movable set $S$ does not hurt the movability.
