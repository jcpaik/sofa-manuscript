We embed a set of moving sofas, in which a sofa of maximum area exists, inside a convex space $\mathcal{L}$. Then we construct an upper bound $\mathcal{Q} : \mathcal{L} \to \mathbb{R}$ of the sofa area which is a concave quadratic functional on $\mathcal{L}$. We show that Gerver's sofa $S_G$ embedded in $\mathcal{L}$ attains a local optimum of $\mathcal{Q}$. As $\mathcal{Q}$ is concave on $\mathcal{L}$, this shows that $S_G$ attains the maximum area.

The essential observation is that under right way of seeing it, the moving sofa problem is a variant of the _isodiametric problem_.
