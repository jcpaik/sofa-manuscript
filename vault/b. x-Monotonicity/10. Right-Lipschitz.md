> __Definition [simple-notation].__ To avoid cluttering, if there is no confusion write $K$ a maximum polygon cap, $n$ a power of 2, $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$, ^def-simple-notation

We will take a uniform polygon cap with step $\delta$. Then we will take $\delta \to 0$ (effectively $n \to \infty$). Write $O_\delta(f(\delta))$ for any term that is bounded by $C f(\delta)$ for $\delta$ sufficiently close to zero.

> __Definition [o-notation].__ We write $f(\delta) = O_\delta(g(\delta))$ if while $f$ can be defined with other values from $\delta$, $g(\delta)$ is purely defined from $\delta$, and there is a constant $C, \epsilon > 0$ such that for every $|\delta| < \epsilon$, we have $|f(\delta)| \leq C g(\delta)$. ^def-o-notation

> __Lemma [leg-bounded].__ For any maximum polygon cap $K$ with step size $\delta = \pi/(2n)$, we have the diameter of $K$ bounded by $5$. Consequently we have $g_K^{\pm}$ and $h_K^{\pm}$ bounded by 5. ^lem-leg-bounded

_Proof._ Circle chord! Observe that $\mathbf{y}_K$ on $I$ is on the circle of diameter $A_K^-(t)$ and $C_K^-(t)$. Diameter at most 4. □

> __Definition [half-line-extension].__ For any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ and angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, denote the infinite line extension of the half-line $b_K(t)$ (resp. $d_K(t)$) as $\overline{b}_K(t)$ (resp. $\overline{d}_K(t)$). Define $H_K^b(t)$ as the closed half-plane bounded by $\overline{b}_K(t)$ in the direction of $u_t$. Likewise, define $H_K^d(t)$ as the closed half-plane bounded by $\overline{d}_K(t)$ in the direction of $v_t$. ^def-half-line-extension

> __Lemma [leg-computation].__ For any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ and $t, \delta > 0$ with $\left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\} \subseteq [0, \pi/2]$, we have the following calculations. ^lem-leg-computation

> 2. $\lambda^1(d_K(t) \cap H_K^b(t - \delta)) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, 1 - g_K^-(t) + \tan(\delta / 2))$

_Proof._ (1) See the left side of [[xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^fig-leg-computation]]. This is a picture of $L_K(t)$ in perspective of upright position. Let $z$ be the intersection of $\overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{d}_K(t)$. Let $\alpha$ be the real value such that $z + \alpha u_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. Then we have $\lambda^1(d_K(t) \cap H_K^r(t + \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$. It remains to show that $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot (g_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta / 2) - 1)$. Let $w_a$ be the intersection of $a_K(t + \delta)$ and $a_K(t)$. Let $w_b$ be the intersection of $\overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{b}_K(t)$. Since the pairs of lines are parallel of distance 1, we have $(w_a - w_b) \cdot v_t = \tan(\delta/2)$. Let $\beta := (\mathbf{x}_K(t) - w_b) \cdot v_t$. By computation before we have $\beta = g_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta / 2) - 1$. Ratio between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot \beta$. □

> __Lemma [balanced-discrete-ineq].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ be any maximum polygon cap with uniform angle set $\Theta := \Theta_{\pi/2, n}$ of size $n-1$ and interval length $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$. Take any $t \in \Theta$ and three consecutive angles $t - \delta, t, t + \delta$. We have the following bound. ^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq
$$
\sigma_K(t + \pi/2) \leq \delta \max(1, g_K^+(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^-(t)) + O(\delta^2)
$$
$$
\sigma_K(t + \pi/2) \leq \int_{t}^{t + \delta} m(g_K^+(u)) \, du
$$

_Proof._ Let $X := d_K(t) \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ be the side(s) of $\mathcal{N}(K)$ contributed by the half-line $d_K(t)$ form $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. The main idea is to bound the length $\lambda^1(X)$ of $X$ from above, and then use balancedness of $K$. Let $U := \left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\}$ and  $R := \bigcup_{u \in U} H_K^b (u)$ be the union of three half-planes. Divide $X$ into $X \cap R$ and $X \setminus R$. We bound $\lambda^1(X \cap R)$ and $\lambda^1(X \setminus R)$ separately.

We first bound $\lambda^1(X \cap R)$ from above. As $X \subseteq d_K(t)$, we have
$$
\lambda^1(X \cap R) \leq \lambda^1(d_K(t) \cap R) = \max(d_K(t) \cap H_K^r(t - \delta), d_K(t) \cap H_K^r(t + \delta))
$$
By the computation in [[xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^lem-leg-computation]], we have
$$
\lambda^1(X \cap R) \leq \delta \max(0, g_K^+(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^-(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$

Now we bound $\lambda^1(X \setminus R)$ from above. Define $Y := R \cup H_-(\pi/2, 0)$. Then $Y$ is disjoint from $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ and the boundary of $Y$ intersects $\overline{d}_K(t)$ at only a finite number of points. Since $X \subseteq \overline{d}_K(t)$, we have
$$
X \setminus R \subseteq d_K(t) \cap \partial (\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup Y).
$$
The set $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup Y$ now contains $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \bigcap_{t \in U} H_K^d(t)$. Define $D_+ = \overline{d}_K(t) \cap \overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $D_- = \overline{d}_K(t) \cap \overline{d}_K(t - \delta)$ as the intersections of infinite extensions of $d_K(t)$ and $d_K(t \pm \delta)$. $\lambda^1(X \setminus R)$ is bounded by the line segment connecting $D_+$ and $D_-$. So
$$
\lambda^1(X \setminus R) \leq \max(0, 2 \tan (\delta / 2) - \sigma_K(t + \pi/2))
$$

$$
\sigma_K(t + \pi/2) \leq \lambda^1(X) \leq \delta \max(0, g_K^+(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^-(t)) + \max(0, \delta - \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)) + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$



Total ignored: $\tan \delta \cdot\max(0, g_K^+(t) - 1 + \tan (\delta/2), 1 + \tan (\delta / 2) - g_K^-(t))$.

Take $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup H_K^r(t - \delta) \cup H_K^r (t + \delta)$. This set now contains the complements of $H_K^l(u)$. The boundary of THIS set is bounded by the segment connecting $D_+$ and $D_-$. 



We will ignore the 

We analyze how much the half-line $d_K(t)$ contributes to the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, bounding $\nu_{K_{\Theta}}(t + \pi/2)$ from above. Then by the balancedness of 

Ignore the right side of $b_K(t)$, $b_K(t \pm \delta)$ completely. This sacrifices the contribution above.

Check computations. 
$h_K^+(t) = h_K^-(t) + \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$.

$h_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^-(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^+(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) - \sec \delta \cdot \sigma$.

$\sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$ if lower bounded by $2 \tan (\delta / 2)$, then should be at most the ignored above.

Make the continuous version. $\max(1, |g_K^{\pm}(t) - 1|)$. This integrated.



Bounds $\sec \delta \geq 1$
$\tan \delta = \delta + O(\delta^3)$
$\sec \delta < \delta + O(\delta^3)$
$\delta g_K^+(t - \delta) = \int_{t - \delta}^t g_K^{\pm}(u) \, du + O(\delta^2)$
Using the estimates, we get
$h_K^+(t - \delta) \geq h_K^+(t) - O(\delta^2)$

Sum over, and $O(\delta)$ terms cannot be ignored but $O(\delta^2)$ and smaller can be ignored
(we sum $O(1/\delta)$ terms)


Q. How does $h^{\pm}_{K_n}$ and $g_{K_n}^{\pm}$ converge to that of $K$ as $n \to \infty$?

Baking a quick proof. 

$p_K$ converges uniformly. 

$p_K'$ left or right derivative exists. Converges in integral.

$v_K^{\pm}(t)$ expressible in $p_K$ and $p_K'$.

# Inequality

$g$ at least one -> $h'$ increasing by at least g>=1, decreases by at most max(one, g - 1). Either way h' never decreases.

no condition on $g$ -> $h'$ increases by $g$, decreases by at most max(one, |g-1|). Either way h' decreases in total by at most one.

# Better Inequality

$h'$ increases by $g$, decreases by D

D : side length

D >= 1 -> D <= |g-1|
0 <= D <= 1 -> D <= 1 - D + |g - 1|. OR, D <= (1 + |g - 1|) / 2.

Either way, D <= max(|g-1|, (1 + |g-1|)/2).

OR, D <= |g-1|/2 + max(|g-1|/2, 1/2)

h' total increment := g - |g-1|/2 - max(|g-1|/2, 1/2)

# Second

$g(\pi/2) \geq 1.1$ 
$g(\pi/2 - t) \geq 1.1 - t$

-> $h'$ increases by $g$, decreases by at most $\max(|g - 1|, )$


# First

$h$ at least one on interval $[0, \pi/4]$ (compute using SofaDesigner)

symmetry. $g$ at least one on interval $[\pi/4, \pi/2]$.

$h$ exactly one on $\pi/2$. $g$ at least one. use above to conclude $h$ at least one. Monotonicity!
