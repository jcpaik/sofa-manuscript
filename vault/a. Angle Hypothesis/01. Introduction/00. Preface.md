Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\mu_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that there is a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @croft2012unsolved]. Specifically, Gerver conjectured that his sofa $S_G$ _is_ the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ and thus the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Numerical experimentations support $S_{\max} = S_G$.[^numerical] Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] derived Gerver's sofa $S_G$ as a candidate of $S_{\max}$ under the following assumptions.

1. $S_{\max}$ rotates clockwise by $\pi/2$ during its movement in $L$.
2. $S_{\max}$ is symmetric along the $y$-axis.
3. The full movement of $S_{\max}$ in $L$ consists of five stages of differentiable movements, in each $S$ makes contact with a specific set of the walls and the inner corner $(0, 0)$ of $L$.

However, all of the assumptions above on $S_{\max}$ remain unproven, leaving $S_{\max} = S_G$ still open to this date.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. ^def-rotation-angle

The first assumption that the maximum-area $S_{\max}$ have rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ seems indispensable in establishing or at least convincing $S_{\max} = S_G$. Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] writes that $\omega = \pi/2$ "seems extremely plausible", but a moving sofa may rotate less than $\pi/2$ in its full movement (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-clipped-sofa]]). Gerver derived his sofa $S_G$ for the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ only (Theorem 2 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]), although it seems that the same calculation could be done for $\omega < \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Figure [clipped-sofa].__ For any $\omega < \pi/2$ close to $\pi/2$, define the sofa $S_\omega$ as the intersection of the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ with $V_\omega$, which is the vertical strip $[0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$. Then $S_\omega$ can move inside $L$ by the rotation angle $\omega$ while being sufficiently close to $S_{\max}$. ^fig-clipped-sofa

As a progress towards [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]], Gerver showed that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Kallus and Romik later improved the lower bound to $\arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ \leq \omega$ with their computer-assisted approach [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. What makes the full proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]] difficult is that there is a moving sofa $S_\omega$ sufficiently close to the optimum sofa $S_{\max}$ in its area, shape, and rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$ (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-clipped-sofa]]). This acts as a barrier for the method of Kallus and Romik that approximates $S$ by a polygon to prove the full equality in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]].

We prove [[#^con-angle]] in this paper.

> __Theorem [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max} := S_{\pi/2}$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^thm-angle

Our proof does not rely on computer assistance. We first restrict the kinds of sofas to _monotone sofas_ which are the intersection of rotating hallways in convex position. Then we use the idea of _balancedness_ by Gerver to bound the side lengths of a maximum-area monotone sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (\sec^{-1}(2.2), \pi/2]$. Then we prove [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] by showing that $S_\omega$ admits a movement of rotation angle $\pi/2$ using a geometric argument.

[^sofa-translation]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate it at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]).

[^sofa-closed]: Taking the closure of a movable set $S$ does not hurt the movability.

[^numerical]: Approximate solutions found by Gibbs [@gibbsComputationalStudySofas2014] in 2014 and Batsch [@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022] in 2022 deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.
