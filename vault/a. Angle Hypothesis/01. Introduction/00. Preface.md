Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\mu_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that there is a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$. Specifically, Gerver conjectured that his sofa $S_G$ _is_ the maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ and thus the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @croft2012unsolved]. Numerical experimentations support Gerver's conjecture $S_{\max} = S_G$. Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] gave a derivation of Gerver's sofa such that, if the following assumptions on the maximum-area $S_{\max}$ were all true, would indeed prove $S_{\max} = S_G$.

1. $S_{\max}$ rotates clockwise by $\pi/2$ during its full movement in $L$.
2. $S_{\max}$ is symmetric along the $y$-axis.
3. The full movement of $S_{\max}$ in $L$ consists of five differentiable stages, where $S$ makes contact with $L$ in specific parts of hallway $L$ for each stage.

However, all of the assumptions above on $S_{\max}$ remain unproven, leaving $S_{\max} = S_G$ still open to this date.


Gerver also only derived his sofa for rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ only, although it seems plausible that the same kind of calculation could in theory be done for rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$. 


The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is defined as the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa have the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. The first assumption of Romik for his derivation of Gerver's sofa. In the words of Romik, the first assumption "seems extremely plausible, that the optimal shape can be transported around the corner using a rigid motion of this type".

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

Gerver showed that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Kallus and Romik later improved the lower bound to $\arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ \leq \omega$ with their computer-assisted approach [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

What makes the full proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]] hard is that, for any $\omega < \pi/2$ sufficiently close to $\pi/2$, there is a moving sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$ sufficiently close to the optimum sofa $S_{\max}$ in its area and shape. Simply take the maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ and intersect it with $R_\omega(V)$ to  $S_\omega$ as the intersection of $S_{\max}$ inside the horizontal side $L_H$ of the hallway, and the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$. This acts as a barrier for the finite-dimensional approximation scheme used by Kallus and Romik will only be able to prove a lower bound which is strictly lesser than $\pi/2$ in finite time. We prove the full [[#^con-angle]] in this paper.

> __Theorem [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^thm-angle

Our proof does not rely on computer assistance. We first restrict the kinds of sofas to _monotone sofas_ which are the intersection of rotating hallways in convex position. Then we use the idea of _balancedness_ by Gerver to bound the side lengths of a _monotone_ sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum-area. Then we show that $S_{\max}$ admits a movement of rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ using a geometric argument.

[^sofa-translation]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate $S$ at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]).
