Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation: 

> What is the connected shape $S_{\max}$ of the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\mu_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37,
$$
where the lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] and the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ is established by the computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that there exists a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @croft2012unsolved], and Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is conjectured to attain the maximum area. However, very limited information is known about the maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ despite decades of partial progress [@hammersley1968enfeeblement; @gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. In particular, it is not even known if such $S_{\max}$ should be unique, or can be assumed to be symmetric along the $y$-axis.

The rotation angle $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is defined as the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa have the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Gerver showed in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] that we can assume $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ for the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$. Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound of $\omega$ with their computer-assited approach by showing $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. With this, we will only consider moving sofas with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, and it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa has $\omega = \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa admitting a movement of rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of the maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ is important in the study of the moving sofa problem. Gerver's derivation of his conjectually optimal sofa $S_G$ relies on the heuristic assumption of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^con-angle]]. The upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ of Kallus and Romik is established by dividing the case of $\omega$ into multiple cases. As we will see in XX, the rotation angle basically determines the sofa geometry. What makes the proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^con-angle]] hard is that, there exists a sufficiently close sofa $S_\omega$ of rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$ to optimum sofa. So the finite-dimensional approximation scheme used by Kallus and Romik will only be able to prove a lower bound which is strictly lesser than $\pi/2$ in finite time.

We prove [[#^con-angle]] in this paper.

The proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^thm-angle]] does not require any computer assistance. We first establish the existence of a _balanced_ sofa
