Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation: 

> What is the connected shape $S_{\max}$ of the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\mu_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37,
$$
where the lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], and the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ comes from the computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. It is conjectured that the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound and Gerver's sofa $S_{G}$ attains the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @croft2012unsolved]. However, very limited information is known about the moving sofa $S_{\max}$ actually attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$, despite decades of partial progress [@hammersley1968enfeeblement; @gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. In particular, it is not even known if such an $S_{\max}$ should be unique or can be assumed to be symmetric along the $y$-axis.

 The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is defined as the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa have the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Gerver showed that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound to $\arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ \leq \omega$ with their computer-assisted approach [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. With this, it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa have rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$.

[[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^con-angle]] is one of the assumptions Gerver made on the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ to derive his conjectually optimum sofa $S_G$. If all the assumptions were all true, then Gerver's sofa $S_G$ would indeed attain the maximum area, resolving the moving sofa problem. However, as all assumptions including [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^con-angle]] remain unproven, that $S_{\max} = S_G$ remains a conjecture. Even if [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^con-angle]] is true, for any $\omega < \pi/2$ sufficiently close to $\pi/2$ there is a moving sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$ sufficiently close to the optimum sofa $S_{\max}$ in its area and shape. Simply take $S_\omega$ as the intersection of $S_{\max}$ inside the horizontal side $L_H$ of the hallway, and the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$. The existence of $S_\omega$ makes the proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^con-angle]] difficult. So the finite-dimensional approximation scheme used by Kallus and Romik will only be able to prove a lower bound which is strictly lesser than $\pi/2$ in finite time.

We prove [[#^con-angle]] in this paper without any computer assistance.

The proof first restricts the kinds of sofas to _monotone sofas_, a kind of sofas which is the intersection of rotating hallways in convex position. Then we use the idea of _balancedness_ by Gerver, which is used to derive his sofa $S_G$, to bound the side lengths of a maximum-area _monotone_ sofa $S_{\max}$. Then,
