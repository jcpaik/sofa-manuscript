We establish this rigorously by showing that a maximum-area moving sofa should be a _monotone sofa_.

The fundamental idea of Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], used in establishing both the lower and upper bound of $\mu_{\max}$ in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/01. Main Result#^eqn-area-bounds]], is to change perspective and solve the moving _hallway_ problem instead. Fix the rotation angle $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$. As $S$ moves inside the hallway $L$, look at the hallway in perspective of $S$ so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway rotates and translates around $S$. This suggests the idea that the moving sofa $S$ is essentially the intersection of rotating hallways $L_t$ of angles $t$ from $0$ to $\omega$ (see ^fig-monotone-sofa).  which is the intersection of 

We claim that a moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ is a common subset of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the rotated hallway $L_t$, which is the hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ are in contact with $S$.
2. The horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
3. A translation of $V_\omega$, where $V_\omega$ is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ around the origin.

To observe (1) that $S \subseteq L_t$ for every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, note that the sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its movement. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$. Push the rotated copy of $S$ in $L$ towards the positive $x$ and $y$ directions, until it makes contact with the outer walls $x=1$ and $y=1$ of $L$. See this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$. To observe (2) and (3), note that the sofa $S$ is initialy in $L_H$ and finally in $L_H$ rotated clockwise by $\omega$; see the configurations in perspective of $S$ to conclude that $S$ is in $H$ and a translation of $V_\omega$.

> __Figure [monotone-sofa].__ The movement of a moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ in perspective of the hallway (left) and the sofa (right). The monotone sofa $S$ is equal to the cap $K$ minus its niche $N$. The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as the tangent lines of cap $K$ (and sofa $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded from above by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

Without loss of generality, we can translate the moving sofa $S$ horizontally and assume that $S$ is contained in $V_\omega$, not its arbitrary translation.[^translation] Then from (1), (2) and (3) above, we can always assume that $S$ is contained in the intersection ^eqn-monotone
$$
\mathcal{M}(S) := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_t
$$
that we will define as the _monotonization_ of a moving sofa $S$. The set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also movable inside $L$; observe that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is in each rotating hallway $L_t$ of angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, and see this in the perspective of the hallway $L$ in fixed position and vary $t$ from $0$ to $\omega$. So the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is a moving sofa containing $S$ ([[c. Upper Bound A1/15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]])[^connectedness], and we call such a sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ from monotonization a _monotone sofa_ ([[c. Upper Bound A1/15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]). Since any moving sofa $S$ is contained in a larger monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$, we only need to consider monotone sofas for the moving sofa problem.

[^translation]: Technically, translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. To resolve this, we relax the [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] of a moving sofa $S$ so that only some translation of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^connectedness]: This uses an implicit assumption that the intersection $\mathcal{M}(S)$ should be connected. Indeed, [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] assumes the connectedness of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ in its proof of Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] without further justification. We prove this assumption rigorously in [[c. Upper Bound A1/15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]].

[^monotonization-monotone]: In fact, that $S$ attains the maximum-area only guarantees that the gain $\mathcal{M}(S) \setminus S$ of monotonization is of measure zero. We show in [[c. Upper Bound A1/15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-fixpoint]] that for any monotone sofa, we have $\mathcal{M}(S) = S$.
