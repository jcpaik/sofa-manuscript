> __Definition [area].__ Denote the area (Borel measure) of a measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. ^def-area

> __Definition [topological-operations].__  For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively. ^def-topological-operations

> __Definition [frame].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$. ^def-frame

Any line on $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be described by the angle $t$ of its normal vector $u_t$ and its (signed) distance from the origin.

> __Definition [line].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the line $l(t, h)$ with the _normal angle_ $t$ and the signed distance $h$ from the origin as ^def-line
$$
l(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h \right\}.
$$

A line on $\mathbb{R}^2$ divides the plane into two half-planes. Following [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-line]], we also give a name to one of the half-planes in the direction of $-u_t$.

> __Definition [half-plane].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the _closed half-planes_ $H_{\pm}(t, h)$ and the _open half-planes_ $H_{\pm}^\circ(t, h)$ of with the boundary $l(t, h)$ as the following. ^def-half-plane
$$
\begin{gather*}
H_-(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h \right\} \qquad H_-^{\circ}(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t < h \right\} \\
H_+(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \geq h \right\} \qquad H_+^{\circ}(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t > h \right\}
\end{gather*}
$$
> We say that the half-planes $H_{-}(t, h)$ and $H_{-}^{\circ}(t, h)$ have the _normal angle_ $t$. Consequently, $H_+(t, h)$ and $H_+^{\circ}(t, h)$ have the normal angle $t + \pi$.

Fix a shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$. Take a sufficiently large $h \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $H(t, h) \supseteq S$. As we decrease $h$ continuously, the line $l(t, h)$ will get close to $S$ until it makes contact with $S$ for the first time. We define the value of $h$, supporting line $l(t, h)$, supporting half-plane $H(t, h)$ as the following [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-support-function]], [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-supporting-line]] and [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-supporting-half-plane]].

> __Definition [support-function].__ For any shape $S$, define its _support function_ $p_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $p_S(t) = \sup \left\{ p \cdot u_t : p \in S \right\}$. ^def-support-function

> __Definition [supporting-line].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _supporting line_ $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $l_S(t) := l(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-supporting-line

> __Definition [supporting-half-plane].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _supporting half-plane_ $H_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $H_S(t) := H_-(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-supporting-half-plane

Observe that the support function $p_S(t)$ measures the signed distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the supporting line $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with the normal vector $u_t$ directing outwards from $S$. Support function and supporting lines of $S$ are usually studied when $S$ is a convex body (e.g. p45 of [[@schneider_2013]]), but in this paper we generalize the notion to arbitrary shape $S$.

> __Definition [width].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, the _width_ of $S$ along the direction of unit vector $u_t$ is defined as $p_S(t) + p_S(t + \pi)$. ^def-width

Geometrically, the width of $S$ along $u_t$ measures the distance between the parallel supporting lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi)$ of $S$.

We adopt the following definition of a convex body (p8 of [[@schneider_2013]]). Many authors also require $K^\circ$ to be nonempty, but we allow $K^\circ$ to be empty (that is, $K$ can be a closed line segment or a point).

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-convex-body

In this paper only, we use the following notions of _vertices_ and _edges_ of a planar convex body $K$.

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, define the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ as the intersection of $K$ with the supporting line $l_K(t)$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Definition [convex-body-vertex].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the edge $e_K(t)$ such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned farthest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned farthest in the opposite direction of $v_t$. We call $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ the _vertices_ of $K$. ^def-convex-body-vertex

It is possible that the edge $e_K(t)$ can be a single point. In such case, the supporting line $l_K(t)$ touches $K$ at the single point $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t)$. In fact, it turns out that this holds for every $t \in S^1$ except for a countable number of values of $t$ ([[c. Upper Bound A1/A1. Convex bodies/10. Surface area measure#^pro-surface-area-singleton-almost-everywhere]]).

We name the parts of the hallway $L$ ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^def-hallway]]).

> __Definition [hallway-parts].__ Let $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ be the inner and outer corner of $L$ respectively. Let $a$ and $c$ be the lines $x=1$ and $y=1$ representing the _outer walls_ of $L$ passing through $\mathbf{y}$. Let $b$ and $d$ be the half-lines $(-\infty, 0] \times \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0 \right\} \times (-\infty, 0]$ representing the _inner walls_ of $L$ emanating from the inner corner $\mathbf{x}$. Let $Q^+ = (-\infty, 1]^2$ be the closed quarter-plane bounded by outer walls $a$ and $c$. Let $Q^- = (-\infty, 0)^2$ be the open quarter-plane bounded by inner walls $b$ and $d$, so that $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$. ^def-hallway-parts
