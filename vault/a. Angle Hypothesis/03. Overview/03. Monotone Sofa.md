A fundamental idea of Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is to see a moving sofa as the intersection of rotating hallways. Fix a moving sofa $S$. As $S$ moves inside the hallway $L$, look at the hallway in the perspective of $S$ so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ rotates and translates around $S$ while containing $S$ (compare the left and right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The sofa $S$ is then a common subset of the rotating hallways. Furthermore, we can parametrize the rotating hallways $L_t$ containing $S$ by its counterclockwise rotation $t$. Let $R_t : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ denote the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ around the origin by the counterclockwise angle of $t$.

_Proof._ The sofa $S$ starts its movement at $L_H \subset H$, so $S$ is contained in $H$. The sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its full movement in $L$. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$ for every $t$ between $0$ and $\omega$. See this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$ for some translation $L_t$ of $R_t(L)$. At the end of its movement, the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by $\omega$ in the vertical side $L_H$. See this in perspective of $S$ to conclude that $S$ is in a translation of $V_\omega$. â–¡

By [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]], any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \geq 0$ is, after some translation, contained in the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ of two strips $H$, $V_\omega$ and rotating hallways $L_t$ for $t \in [0, \omega]$. That is, ^eqn-sofa-intersection
$$
S \subseteq \mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t.
$$
For $S$ to attain the maximum area, $S$ should be the connected component of $\mathcal{I}$ of largest area. Furthermore, if we _assume_ that $\mathcal{I}$ is connected, then the equality $S = \mathcal{I}$ would hold for maximum-area $S$. Most literature maximizes $S$ by maximizing $\mathcal{I}$ with respect to controlling $L_t$.

However, the equality between $S$ and $\mathcal{I}$ has not been rigorously established in existing literature.[^connectedness] We prove that any maximum-area $S = S_{\max}$, up to a difference of measure zero, satisfies the following properties.

1. Each rotating hallway $L_t$ can be taken to be the _tangent hallways_ of $S$ making contact with $S$ in its outer walls.
2. The sofa $S$ is equal to the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ of strips $H, V_\omega$ and tangent hallways $L_t$.

We will call any moving sofa $S$ (not necessarily of maximum area) satisfying the two properties above a _monotone sofa_. Thus, it suffices to only consider monotone sofas to find a maximum-area moving sofa. As a consequence, the outer walls of $L_t$ form the supporting lines of a convex body $K$ that we call the _cap_ of $S$ (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/03. Monotone Sofa#^fig-monotone-sofa]]).

> __Figure [monotone-sofa].__ The movement of a moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ in perspective of the hallway (left) and the sofa (right). The monotone sofa $S$ is equal to the cap $K$ minus its niche $N$. The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as the tangent lines of cap $K$ (and sofa $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded from above by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

[^translation]: Technically, translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. We will relax the full [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] of a moving sofa $S$ so that only some translation of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^connectedness]: [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] does not assume. $\mathcal{T}$ .  [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] explicitly the difference between $S$ and $\mathcal{I}$, but then _assumes_ it without proof for the derivation of Gerver's sofa. [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]
