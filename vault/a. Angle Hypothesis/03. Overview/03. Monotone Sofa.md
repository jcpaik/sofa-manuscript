A fundamental idea of Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is to see a moving sofa as the intersection of rotating hallways. Fix a moving sofa $S$. As $S$ moves inside the hallway $L$, look at the hallway in the perspective of $S$ so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ rotates and translates around $S$ while containing $S$ (see the right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The sofa $S$ is then a common subset of the rotating hallways. Furthermore, we can parametrize the rotating hallways $L_t$ containing $S$ by its counterclockwise rotation $t$. Let $R_t : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ denote the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ around the origin by the counterclockwise angle of $t$.

_Proof._ The sofa $S$ starts its movement at $L_H \subset H$, so $S$ is contained in $H$. The sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its full movement in $L$. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$ for every $t$ between $0$ and $\omega$. See this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$ for some translation $L_t$ of $R_t(L)$. At the end of its movement, the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by $\omega$ in the vertical side $L_H$. See this in perspective of $S$ to conclude that $S$ is in a translation of $V_\omega$. â–¡

Assume the rotation angle $\omega \geq 0$ of a moving sofa $S$. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, let $\mathbf{x}(t)$ be the location of the inner corner of the hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ containing $S$. Then $L_t = R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t)$ and the intersection
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t) \right)
$$
contains the moving sofa $S$. Assuming that the intersection $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ is connected and  $\mathbf{x}:[0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuous, the problem becomes the maximization of the area of $S$ with respect to the coordinates of inner corners $L_t$. Note that a monotone sofa is when each hallway is the tangent hallway. 

We introduce the notion of _monotone sofas_. It suffices to assume that each $L_t$ is in convex position; that is, the outer walls of $L_t$ forms the supporting lines of a convex body. push a hallway $L_t$ towards $S$

> __Figure [monotone-sofa].__ The movement of a moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ in perspective of the hallway (left) and the sofa (right). The monotone sofa $S$ is equal to the cap $K$ minus its niche $N$. The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as the tangent lines of cap $K$ (and sofa $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded from above by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

This uses an implicit assumption that the intersection $\mathcal{M}(S)$ should be connected. Indeed, [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] assumes the connectedness of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ in its proof of Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] without further justification. We prove this assumption rigorously in [[c. Upper Bound A1/15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]].


[^translation]: Technically, translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. We will relax the full [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] of a moving sofa $S$ so that only some translation of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^monotonization-monotone]: In fact, that $S$ attains the maximum-area only guarantees that the gain $\mathcal{M}(S) \setminus S$ of monotonization is of measure zero. We show in [[c. Upper Bound A1/15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-fixpoint]] that for any monotone sofa, we have $\mathcal{M}(S) = S$.
