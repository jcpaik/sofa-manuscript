Assume a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$. Note that $H \cap V_{\omega}$ is a parallelogram of area $\tan(\omega)$. So we can assume that $\omega \geq \arctan(2.2)$. We establish [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] by showing that the same sofa also admits another movement of rotation angle $\pi/2$.

We reproduce the argument of Gerver (p271 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]) for completeness.

_Proof._ If $\omega \leq -\pi/4$, then by XX a translation of $S$ is a common subset of $H$ and $L_{-\pi/4}$, where $L_{-\pi/4}$ is a translation of $R_{-\pi/4}(L)$. The intersection of $H$ and $L_{-\pi/4}$ has area $\sqrt{2} = 1.4142\dots$ always, so the area of $S$ cannot attain the maximum value.

If $|\omega| \leq \sec^{-1}(2.2)$, then by XX a translation of $S$ is a common subset of $H$ and $V_\omega$. The intersection $H \cap V_\omega$ is then a parallelogram of area $\sec(\omega)$ .

Finally, assume $\omega > \pi/2$. We show that $S$ also admits another movement in $L$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$. Starting with a translation $S_0$ of $S$ in the horizontal side $L_H$, follow the movement of $S$ inside $L$ with rotation $\omega$ and stop in the middle where $S$ is rotated clockwise by exactly $\pi/2$. Call the copy of $S$ at this moment $S_{\pi/2}$. Translate $S_{\pi/2}$ horizontally in the positive $x$-axis Since $S$ is contained in $L_H$,

To prove [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/03. Monotone Sofa#^thm-extend-rotation-angle]], we will find two 

The idea is to extend the original movement with rotation angle $\omega$. Initially, the monotone sofa $S$ is contained in the parallelogram $P_\omega = H \cap V_\omega$. Call the lower-left and the upper-right vertex of $P_\omega$ as $o_\omega$ and $O_\omega$. Define $\Delta_\omega$ as the subset of $P_\omega$ under the arc formed by the circle of radius 1 centered at $p_\omega$. from $p_\omega - u_\omega$ to $p_\omega - v_0$  If the small region $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from the moving sofa $S$, then we can rotate the translate of $S$ inside $L_H$ _counterclockwise_ by an angle of $\pi/2 - \omega$. Combine this movement with the movement of $S$ in $L$ to get a movement of $S$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$.

So how do we show that $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from $S$? We will show that there is some $t$ such that the inner corner $Q_K^-(t)$ contains the set $\Delta_\omega$. We will need to bound two values from below. First is the length $p_K(0)$ from the origin. Second is the length of the edge $e_K(\pi/2)$ with the normal vector $(0, 1)$. Now the points $q_1 = (p_K(0), 0)$ and $q_2 = o_\omega - \beta_K(\pi/2)$ are in $K$. The positive quadrant $Q_K^+(t)$ of the hallway $L_t$ should contain the two points $q_1$ and $q_2$. We find a proper value of $t$ so that the negative quadrant $Q_K^-(t)$ contains the set $\Delta_\omega$ all.

Bounding $q_1$, or letting $p_K(0) \geq 1.1$ is sufficient by using symmetry argument. However, bounding the edge length $e_K(\pi/2)$ from below . The rightmost point $q_0$ of $S$ on the line $y=0$. The leftmost point $q_1$ of $S$ on the line $y=1$.
