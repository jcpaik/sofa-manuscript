We start with a simple bound of Gerver.

> __Lemma [rotation-angle-simple-bound].__ (Modification of p271, [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]) Let $S$ be any moving sofa of area $> 2.2$. Then $S$ admits a movement in $L$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (\sec^{-1}(2.2) , \pi/2]$. ^lem-rotation-angle-simple-bound

_Proof._ Assume any movement of $S$ inside $L$ with rotation angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. If $\omega \leq -\pi/4$, then by [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]] a translation of $S$ is a common subset of $H$ and $L_{-\pi/4}$, where $L_{-\pi/4}$ is a translation of $R_{-\pi/4}(L)$. The intersection of $H$ and $L_{-\pi/4}$ has area $\sqrt{2} = 1.4142\dots$ always, contradicting $|S| > 2.2$. If $|\omega| \leq \sec^{-1}(2.2)$, then by [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]] a translation of $S$ is a common subset of $H$ and $V_\omega$. The intersection $H \cap V_\omega$ is then a parallelogram of area $\sec(\omega) \leq 2.2$, again contradicting $|S| > 2.2$. So we should have $\sec^{-1}(2.2) < \omega$.

Assume $\omega > \pi/2$, or otherwise we are done. We show that $S$ also admits another movement in $L$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$. Follow the movement of $S$ inside $L$ with rotation $\omega$ from the start, and stop in the middle where $S$ is rotated clockwise by exactly $\pi/2$. Call the copy of $S$ at this moment $S_{\pi/2}$. Translate $S_{\pi/2}$ horizontally in the positive direction of the $x$-axis, until it makes contact with the outer right wall $x=1$ of $L$. Since $S$ is initially in $L_H$, the width of $S_{\pi/2}$ measured along the $x$-axis is at most one. So after the additional horizontal translation, $S_{\pi/2}$ lies inside $L_V$ with the rotation angle of $\pi/2$. â–¡

By [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^lem-rotation-angle-simple-bound]] and Gerver's sofa of area $\mu_G = 2.2195\dots > 2.2$, we can assume the rotation angle $\omega \in (\sec^{-1}(2.2), \pi/2]$. Recall that the monotone sofa $S_\omega$ in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-maximum-area-polygon-limit]], if shown, would attain the maximum area with fixed rotation angle $\omega$. We will establish [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] by showing that $S_\omega$ also admits a movement with rotation angle $\pi/2$. We show that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from a triangular region $\Delta_\omega$, so that $S_\omega$ will be able to rotate _counterclockwise_ by $\pi/2 - \omega$ inside $L_H$ ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/15. Proof of the Main Theorem/00. Preface#^thm-balanced-consumed]]; see Fig). Reverse this movement and combine it with the original movement of $S_\omega$ in $L$ rotating clockwise by $\omega$, to obtain a movement of $R_{\pi/2 - \omega}(S_\omega)$ in $L$ with full rotation angle $\pi/2$. 

We also sketch the proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/15. Proof of the Main Theorem/00. Preface#^thm-balanced-consumed]] that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$. Let $K$ be the cap of $S_\omega$. By the balancedness of the polygons $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ approximating $S_\omega$, we obtain that the length of the edge $e_K(\pi/2)$ is bounded from below by the _niche gap_ $w_K^{\circ}$. This allows us to find two specific points $q_0$ and $q_1$ on the boundary of $K$ (see XX). The tangent hallway $L_{\pi/2 - \omega}$ of $S_\omega$ in particular should contain the two points $q_0, q_1$. The points $q_0$ and $q_1$ are chosen so that the inner walls of $L_{\pi/2 - \omega}$ enclose the triangular region $\Delta_\omega$, showing that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$ as we wanted.
