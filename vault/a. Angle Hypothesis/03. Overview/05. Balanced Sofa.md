We identified a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ with the intersection $\mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t$ of strips and rotating hallways in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Overview/03. Monotone Sofa]]. Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] derived his sofa $S_G$ using a discrete approximation of $\mathcal{I}$. Take a finite subset $\Theta$ of $(0, \omega)$ and the polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
\mathcal{I}_\Theta := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_t
$$
as the approximation of $S = \mathcal{I}$. Ignoring the connectedness of $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ for now, the approximated problem is to maximize the area of $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ by freely translating each hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by $t \in \Theta$.

Gerver called a polygon $P$ _balanced_ if for any unit vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the sum of the lengths of edges of $P$ with normal vector $v$ is equal to that of the opposite normal vector $-v$. A maximum-area $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ then should be balanced; otherwise, we could push one of the $H$, $V_\omega$ or $L_t$ by a small distance in a direction orthogonal to the unbalanced side lengths and increase the area slightly (and if we pushed $H$ or $V_\omega$, translate the whole $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ to move $H$ or $V_\omega$ back to its position). Gerver derived his conjectually optimum sofa $S_G$ by taking the limit of balanced intersections $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ as $\Theta$ becomes denser in $[0, \omega]$. This argument is streamlined in [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] as a set of ordinary differential equations.

However, the argument may break if we require $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ to be connected.

We show that for any

In this paper, we mitigate the issue by defining the _sofa area functional_ that separates the area contribution of the cap $K$ and its niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. We will optimize for the value $|K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$, no matter whether $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \subseteq K$ or not. We will analyze the 

On the way of proving [[#^thm-angle-cap]], we also show the following existence theorem of maxima of $\mathcal{A}_\omega$ satisfying certain properties.
