An argument of Gerver proves that a maximum-area sofa have rotation angle $\omega \in (\sec^{-1}(2.2), \pi/2]$. So assume such $\omega$.
We will build the notion of _monotone_ and _balanced_. So a maximum-area sofa is both.
By monotoneness, $S_{\max}$ will be a convex set $K$ called a _cap_, which is a convex body inscribed in a parallelogram $P_\omega = H \cap V_\omega$. 
By balancedness of $S_{\max}$, (see XX for a sketch), we will have $w_K^{\circ} \leq \sigma_K(\pi/2)$ as depicted in Figure XX, where $w_K^{\circ}$ is a lower bound of the lower edge.


Since $S_{\max}$ have area at least that of Gerver's sofa, we can assume that one of the bottom sides $\sigma_K(\omega + \pi)$ or $\sigma_K(3\pi/2)$ are large enough. 
By reflecting $K$ if necessary, assume that the bottom side $\sigma_K(3\pi/2)$ is large.
Since
