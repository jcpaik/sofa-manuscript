In the previous [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa]], we identified a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ with the intersection $\mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t$ of strips and rotating hallways. Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] derived his sofa $S_G$ using a discrete approximation of $\mathcal{I}$. Take a finite nonempty subset $\Theta$ of $(0, \omega)$ and the polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
S_\Theta := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_t
$$
as the approximation of $S = \mathcal{I}$. Ignoring the connectedness of $S_\Theta$ for now, the approximated problem is to maximize the area of $S_\Theta$ by freely translating a finite number of hallways $L_t$ each rotated counterclockwise by $t \in \Theta$.

Define a polygon $P$ _balanced_ if for any unit vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the sum of the lengths of edges of $P$ with normal vector $v$ is equal to that of the opposite normal vector $-v$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].[^balanced] A (not necessarily connected) maximum-area $S_\Theta$ should be balanced. Otherwise, we could push one of the $H$, $V_\omega$ or $L_t$ by a small distance in a direction orthogonal to the unbalanced side lengths and increase the area slightly, and if we pushed either $H$ or $V_\omega$, translate the whole $S_\Theta$ to move $H$ or $V_\omega$ back to its position. Call this process increasing the area of $S_\Theta$ _balancing_ $S_\Theta$.

Gerver derived his conjectually optimum sofa $S_G$ by taking the limit of balanced intersections $S_\Theta$ as $\Theta$ becomes denser in $[0, \omega]$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. This argument is streamlined in [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] as solving a set of ordinary differential equations. However, the balancing argument on $S_\Theta$ may break if we require $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ to be connected, as it is possible that moving one of $L_t$ in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/05. Balanced Sofa#^eqn-polygon]] may make $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$ disconnected (see Figure XX). This is another logical gap 

Instead of requring $S_{\Theta}$ to be connected, we will write $S_\Theta = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ as the difference of a polygon cap $K$ and polygon niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. Then we adjust $K$ and $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ separately and maximize $|K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$ with respect to the polygon cap $K$, no matter whether $S_{\Theta}$ is connected or not. We show that the maximizer $K_\Theta$ is balanced, in the sense that the sum of side lengths of $K$ and $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}(K)$ balance with each other.

We will show that as $\Theta$ gets denser in $[0,\omega]$, the maximum polygon cap $K_\Theta$ in   converge to a monotone sofa attaining the maximum area with the fixed rotation angle $\omega$.

> __Theorem [maximum-area-polygon-limit].__ (abriged; see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum-area Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-sofa]] for the full statement.) For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, there exists a monotone sofa $S_\omega$ satisfying the followings. ^thm-maximum-area-polygon-limit
> 
> 1. $S_\omega$ attains the maximum area among all moving sofas of rotation angle $\omega$.
> 2. As $n \to \infty$, there is a sequence of finite sets $\Theta_n \subset (0, \omega)$ getting denser in $[0, \omega]$, so that the balanced polygon sofas $S_{\Theta_n}$ in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-polygon-sofa-connected]] converge to $S_\omega$.

As a consequence of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-maximum-area-polygon-limit]], we show that the _niche gaps_ (see XX) provide effective lower bounds of the side lengths of $S_\omega$.

[^balanced]: Gerver's definition of balancedness in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] also require the parallel sides of opposite directions to have distance 1. But this does not make any difference for $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$, as the parallel sides of opposite directions always have distance 1 in $\mathcal{I}_\Theta$.
