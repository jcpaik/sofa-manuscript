A fundamental idea of Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is to see a moving sofa as the intersection of rotating hallways. Fix a moving sofa $S$. As $S$ moves inside the hallway $L$, look at the hallway in the perspective of $S$ so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ rotates and translates around $S$ while containing $S$ (compare the left and right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The sofa $S$ is then a common subset of the rotating hallways. Furthermore, we can parametrize the rotating hallways $L_t$ containing $S$ by its counterclockwise rotation $t$.

> __Definition [rotation-map].__ Let $R_t : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ denote the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ around the origin by the counterclockwise angle of $t \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-rotation-map

> __Definition [strips].__ Define the horizontal strip $H := \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, vertical strip $V := [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$, and its rotation $V_\omega := R_\omega(V)$ around the origin by a counterclockwise angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-strips

> __Proposition [moving-sofa-common-subset].__ Fix an arbitrary moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is, after some translation, contained in each of the following sets. ^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset

> 1. The horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R}$.
> 2. For every angle $t$ between $0$ and $\omega$ (that is, $t \in [0, \omega]$ if $\omega \geq 0$ and $t \in [\omega, 0]$ if $\omega < 0$), the rotating hallway $L_t$ which is a translation of $R_t(L)$.
> 3. The rotated vertical strip $V_\omega$.

_Proof._ Translate $S$ to its initial position of movement in $L_H \subset H$, then automatically $S \subset H$. The sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its movement in $L$. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$ for every $t$ between $0$ and $\omega$. See this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subset L_t$ for some translation $L_t$ of $R_t(L)$. At the end of its movement, the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by $\omega$ in the vertical side $L_H$. See this in perspective of $S$ to conclude that $S$ is in a translation of $V_\omega$. Now translate $S$ and $L_t$ together horizontally to preserve $S \subset H$ and $S \subset L_t$ while having $S \subset V_\omega$ without loss of generality. â–¡

By [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]], any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \geq 0$ is, after some translation, contained in the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ of two strips $H$, $V_\omega$ and rotating hallways $L_t$ for $t \in [0, \omega]$. That is, ^eqn-sofa-intersection
$$
S \subseteq \mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t.
$$
It seems natural to identify $S$ with $\mathcal{I}$ for a maximum-area $S$. Indeed, all known derivations of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] (locally) maximizes $S$ by translating each $L_t$ to maximize $\mathcal{I}$. However, as a moving sofa $S$ should be connected, the equality $S = \mathcal{I}$ will not hold if $\mathcal{I}$ is disconnected. The connectedness of $\mathcal{I}$ for maximum-area $S$ is not established rigorously in existing literatures [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].[^connectedness]

In [[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]], we prove that any moving sofa $S$ maximal under set inclusion $\subset$ satisfies the following properties, establishing both the connectedness of $\mathcal{I}$ and $S = \mathcal{I}$.

1. Each rotating hallway $L_t$ can be taken to be the _tangent hallways_ of $S$ making contact with $S$ in its outer walls ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway-contains]]; see the right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^fig-monotone-sofa]]).
2. Taking $L_t$ as the tangent hallways of $S$, the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ is connected (proof of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/10. Monotone Sofa#^thm-monotonization]]) and the equality $S = \mathcal{I}$ holds in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^eqn-sofa-intersection]] ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/12. Cap and Niche#^thm-monotone-sofa-structure]]).

We define the notion of _monotone sofas_ ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/10. Monotone Sofa#^thm-monotonization]]), so that any moving sofa $S$ (not necessarily of maximum area) satisfies the properties (1) and (2) above if and only if $S$ is a monotone sofa. Thus it suffices to consider only monotone sofa $S$ for the moving sofa problem.

As a consequence of (1), the outer walls of tangent hallways $L_t$ of a monotone sofa $S$ form the supporting lines of a convex body $K$ that we call the _cap_ of $S$ (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). We will identify a monotone sofa $S$ with its cap $K$. In particular, the monotone sofa $S = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$ is completely determined by its cap $K$ ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/12. Cap and Niche#^thm-monotone-sofa-structure]]), where $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the _niche_ of $K$ which is the union of all triangular regions bounded by the inner walls of $L_t$. We also prove $\mathcal{N}(K) \subset K$ ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Structure of a Monotone Sofa#^thm-niche-in-cap]]) so the area $|K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ of $S$ can be understood in terms of its cap and niche separately. With this, the moving sofa problem becomes the maximization of the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A}_{\omega}(K) := |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ on a convex body $K$ ([[a. Angle Hypothesis/15. Proof of the Main Theorem/00. Preface#^thm-sofa-area-functional-summary]]).

[^translation]: Technically, translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. We will relax the full [[b. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] of a moving sofa $S$ so that only some translation of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^connectedness]: [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] requires a moving sofa $S$ to be connected (p267). The proof of Theorem 1 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] then defines a collection $\mathcal{T}$ in which he finds a set $T \in \mathcal{T}$ of maximum area. However, it is not shown that $T$ should be connected, which is a logical gap in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] does not require the connectedness of a moving sofa $S$ and assumes the equality $S = \mathcal{I}$ (Equation 8, p319), allowing $S$ to be disconnected in principle. [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018] rigorously treats the connectedness of $S$ by letting $S$ be the _connected component_ of $\mathcal{I}$ of the largest area instead.
