A fundamental idea of Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is to see a moving sofa as the intersection of rotating hallways. Fix a moving sofa $S$. As $S$ moves inside the hallway $L$, look at the hallway in the perspective of $S$ so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ rotates and translates around $S$ while containing $S$ (compare the left and right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The sofa $S$ is then a common subset of the rotating hallways. Furthermore, we can parametrize the rotating hallways $L_t$ containing $S$ by its counterclockwise rotation $t$.

> __Definition [rotation-map].__ Let $R_t : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ denote the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ around the origin by the counterclockwise angle of $t \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-rotation-map

> __Proposition [moving-sofa-common-subset].__ Fix an arbitrary moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is, after some translation, contained in each of the following sets. ^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset

> 1. The horizontal strip $H := \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
> 2. For every angle $t$ between $0$ and $\omega$ (that is, $t \in [0, \omega]$ if $\omega \geq 0$ and $t \in [\omega, 0]$ if $\omega < 0$), the rotating hallway $L_t$ which is a translation of $R_t(L)$.
> 3. The strip $V_\omega := R_\omega(V)$ which is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ around the origin.

_Proof._ Translate $S$ to its initial position of movement in $L_H \subset H$, then automatically $S \subset H$. The sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its movement in $L$. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$ for every $t$ between $0$ and $\omega$. See this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subset L_t$ for some translation $L_t$ of $R_t(L)$. At the end of its movement, the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by $\omega$ in the vertical side $L_H$. See this in perspective of $S$ to conclude that $S$ is in a translation of $V_\omega$. Now translate $S$ and $L_t$ together horizontally to preserve $S \subset H$ and $S \subset L_t$ while having $S \subset V_\omega$ without loss of generality. â–¡

By [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]], any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \geq 0$ is, after some translation, contained in the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ of two strips $H$, $V_\omega$ and rotating hallways $L_t$ for $t \in [0, \omega]$. That is, ^eqn-sofa-intersection
$$
S \subseteq \mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t.
$$
If the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ is connected for the maximum-area $S$, then the equality $S = \mathcal{I}$ would hold. Existing literature maximizes $S$ by controlling the locations of $L_t$ to maximize the intersection $\mathcal{I}$. But the connectedness of $\mathcal{I}$ for maximum-area $S$ (and thus the equality $S = \mathcal{I}$) has not been rigorously established yet.[^connectedness] We prove in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]] that any moving sofa $S$ maximal under set inclusion $\subset$ satisfies the following properties, establishing $S = \mathcal{I}$ in particular.

1. Each rotating hallway $L_t$ can be taken to be the _tangent hallways_ of $S$ making contact with $S$ in its outer walls (see the right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^fig-monotone-sofa]]).
2. Under (1), the sofa $S$ is equal to the intersection $\mathcal{I}$ in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^eqn-sofa-intersection]].

We will call any moving sofa $S$ (not necessarily of maximum area) satisfying the two properties above a _monotone sofa_. Thus it suffices to consider only monotone sofa $S$ for the moving sofa problem.

As a consequence of (1), the outer walls of tangent hallways $L_t$ form the supporting lines of a convex body $K$ that we call the _cap_ of $S$ (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/03. Outline/03. Monotone Sofa#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). The monotone sofa $S$ is then equal to the cap $K$ minus its _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ of $K$, which is the union of all triangular regions bounded by the inner walls of $L_t$. We prove $\mathcal{N}(K) \subset K$, so the area $|K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ of a monotone sofa $S$ can be understood separately in terms of its cap and niche. As $S = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$ is completely determined from its cap $K$, we will _always_ understand a monotone sofa $S$ by its cap $K$.

[^translation]: Technically, translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. We will relax the full [[c. Upper Bound A1/10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] of a moving sofa $S$ so that only some translation of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^connectedness]: In [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], Gerver defines the collection $\mathcal{T}$ of all such intersection $\mathcal{I}$ and find a set $T \in \mathcal{T}$ attaining the maximum area, but it is not shown that $T$ should be connected. In [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018], Romik differentiates $S$ and $\mathcal{I}$ and explicitly assumes $S = \mathcal{I}$ without proof for the derivation of $S_G$. In [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018], Romik and Kallus let $S$ be the connected component of $\mathcal{I}$ of largest area instead.
