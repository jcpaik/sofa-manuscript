We define standard notions on a planar convex body $K$. Here, $S^1$ is taken as $\mathbb{R} / 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$. We will often denote an element of $S^1$ by its representation in $\mathbb{R}$.

> __Definition [area].__ Denote the area (Borel measure) of a Borel measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. ^def-area

> __Definition [topological-operations].__  For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively. ^def-topological-operations

> __Definition [frame].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$. ^def-frame

> __Definition [line].__ For any $t\in S^1$ and $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the line $l(t, h)$ with the _normal angle_ $t$ and the signed distance $h$ from the origin as ^def-line
$$
l(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h \right\}.
$$

> __Definition [half-plane].__ For any $t \in S^1$ and $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the _closed half-planes_ $H_{\pm}(t, h)$ and the _open half-planes_ $H_{\pm}^\circ(t, h)$ with the boundary $l(t, h)$ as the following. ^def-half-plane
$$
\begin{gather*}
H_-(t, h) := \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h \right\} \qquad H_-^{\circ}(t, h) := \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t < h \right\} \\
H_+(t, h) := \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \geq h \right\} \qquad H_+^{\circ}(t, h) := \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t > h \right\}
\end{gather*}
$$
> We say that $H_{-}(t, h)$ and $H_{-}^{\circ}(t, h)$ have the _normal angle_ $t$ and _normal vector_ $u_t$.

Consequently, $H_+(t, h)$ and $H_+^{\circ}(t, h)$ have the normal angle $t + \pi$.

> __Definition [support-function].__ For any nonempty and compact $S$, define its _support function_ $h_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $h_S(t) := \sup \left\{ s \cdot u_t : s \in S \right\}$. ^def-support-function

> __Definition [supporting-line-half-plane].__ For any nonempty and compact $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _supporting line_ $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as $l_S(t) := l(t, h_S(t))$. Define the _supporting half-plane_ $H_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as $H_S(t) := H_-(t, h_S(t))$. ^def-supporting-line-half-plane

> __Definition [width].__ For any nonempty and compact $S$ and angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, the _width_ of $S$ along the direction of angle $t$ (or unit vector $u_t$) is the distance between the parallel supporting lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi)$ of $S$ defined as $h_S(t) + h_S(t + \pi)$. ^def-width

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _(planar) convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Define $\mathcal{K}$ as the collection of all convex bodies $K$. ^def-convex-body

Note that many authors also require $K^\circ$ to be nonempty in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/04. Notations/00. Preface#^def-convex-body]], but we allow $K^\circ$ to be empty following [@schneider_2013]. That is, a closed line segment or a point is also a convex body.

In this paper only, we use the following notions of _vertices_ and _edges_ of a convex body $K$.

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, define the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ as the intersection of $K$ with the supporting line $l_K(t)$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Definition [convex-body-vertex].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the edge $e_K(t)$ such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned farthest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned farthest in the opposite direction $-v_t$. We call $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ the _vertices_ of $K$. ^def-convex-body-vertex

It is possible that the edge $e_K(t)$ can be a single point. In such case, the supporting line $l_K(t)$ touches $K$ at the single point $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t)$.

> __Definition [hausdorff-measure].__ Define $\mathcal{H}^1$ as the _Hausdorff measure of dimension one_ on $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-hausdorff-measure

That is, if $X$ is a disjoint union of finite line segments in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $\mathcal{H}^1(X)$ is the sum of all lengths of the line segments.

> __Definition [hausdorff-distance].__ Denote the _Hausdorff distance_ between convex bodies $K_1$ and $K_2$ as $d_{\mathrm{H}}$, which is the supremum norm between $h_{K_1}$ and $h_{K_2}$ (Lemma 1.8.14, page 66 of [@schneider_2013]). ^def-hausdorff-distance

> __Definition [surface-area-measure].__ Denote the _surface area measure_ of a convex body $K$ as $\sigma_K$. For simplicity, denote $\sigma_K(\left\{ t \right\})$ as $\sigma_K(t)$. ^def-surface-area-measure

We refer to page 214 of [[@schneider_2013]] for a full construction of $\sigma_K$. It measures the side lengths of $K$, which is the defining property of $\sigma_K$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure].__ (Theorem 4.2.3 of [[@schneider_2013]]) For any Borel subset $X$ of $S^1$, the value $\sigma_K(X)$ is the Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^1$ of the union $\bigcup_{t \in X} e_K(t)$ of edges of $K$. ^thm-surface-area-measure

So if $K$ is a convex polygon, then $\sigma_K$ is a discrete measure such that the measure $\sigma_K\left( t \right)$ at point $t$ is the length of the edge $e_K(t)$. For another example, assume that $K$ is a smooth convex polygon where for every $t \in S^1$, the tangent line $l_K(t)$ always meets $K$ at a single point $v(t) = v_K^{\pm}(t)$ which is smooth in $t \in S^1$. Then the distribution function $R : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ of $\sigma_K$ is the radius of curvature $R(t) = \left\lVert v'(t) \right\rVert$ of $\partial K$ at $v(t)$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-side-length].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, $\sigma_K(t)$ is the length of the edge $e_K(t)$. Consequently, $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t) + \sigma_K(t) v_t$. ^thm-surface-area-measure-side-length

_Proof._ Let $X = \left\{ t \right\}$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/04. Notations/00. Preface#^thm-surface-area-measure]]. □

We add the following definition.

> __Definition [convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. For every $a, b \in S^1$ such that $b \neq a,  a + \pi$, define $v_K(a, b)$ as the intersection $l_K(a) \cap l_K(b)$. ^def-convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection

We prove a technical lemma on the limit of vertices of $K$.

> __Theorem [limits-converging-to-vertex].__ Let $K$ be any convex body and $t \in S^1$ be an arbitrary angle. We have the following right limits converging to $v_K^+(t)$. In particular, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is right-continuous on $t \in S^1$. ^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex
$$
\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^+(t) = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K(t, t') = v_K^+(t)
$$
> Similarly, we have the following left limits.
$$
\lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K^+(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K^-(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K(t', t) = v_K^-(t)
$$

_Proof._ We only compute the right limits. Left limits can be shown using a symmetric argument.

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Let $p = v_K^+(t) + \epsilon v_t$. By the definition of $v_K^+(t)$, the point $p$ is not in $K$. As $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus K$ is open, we can take some positive $\epsilon' < \epsilon$ such that the closed line segment $s$ connecting $p$ and $q = p - \epsilon' u_t$ is disjoint from $K$ as well. Define the closed right-angled triangle $T$ with vertices $v_K^+(t)$, $p$, and $q$. Take the line $l$ that passes through both $q$ and $v_K^+(t)$. Call the two closed half-planes divided by the line $l$ as $H_T$ and $H'$, where $H_T$ contains $p$ and $H'$ does not contain $p$. By definition, $H'$ has normal angle $t' \in (t, t + \pi/2)$.

We show that $K \cap H_T \subseteq T$. Observe that the intersection $X := H_K(t) \cap H_T$ is a cone centered at the point $v_K^+(t)$, with the line segment $s$ dividing $X$ into triangle $T$ and an unbounded convex set $X \setminus T$. Now take any point $r \in K \cap H_T$. If $r \not\in T$, then since $r \in X \setminus T$ and $v_K^+(t) \in T$ the line connecting $r \in K$ and $v_K^+(t) \in K$ should pass through a point in $s$. This, however, contradicts that $s$ is disjoint from convex $K$. So we should have $r \in T$ and thus $K \cap H_T \subseteq T$.

Now take arbitrary $t_0 \in (t, t')$. We show that the edge $e_K(t_0)$ should lie inside $T$. It suffices to show that any point $z$ in $K$ that attains the maximum value of $z \cdot u_{t_0}$ is in $T$. Define the fan $F := H_K(t) \cap H'$, so that $F$ is bounded by lines $l_K(t)$ and $l$ with the vertex $v_K^+(t)$. If $z \in F$, it should be that $z = v_K^+(t) \in T$, because $v_K^+(t) \in K$ and $v_K^+(t) \cdot u_{t_0} > z \cdot u_{t_0}$ for every point $z$ in $F$ other than $z = v_K^+(t)$. If $z \in K \setminus F$ on the other hand, we have $K \setminus F = K \setminus H' \subseteq K \cap H_T \subseteq T$ so $z \in T$. This completes the proof of $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$.

Observe that the triangle $T$ contains $v_K^+(t)$ and has diameter $< 2\epsilon$ because the two perpendicular sides of $T$ containing $p$ have length $\leq \epsilon$. So the endpoints $v_K^+(u)$ and $v_K^-(u)$ of the edge $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$ are distance at most $2\epsilon$ away from $v_K^+(t)$. This completes the epsilon-delta argument for $\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^+(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^-(t') = v_K^+(t)$. 

From $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$ and that the vertex $p$ of $T$ maximizes the value of $z \cdot u_{t_0}$ over all $z \in T$, we get that $p$ is either on $l_K(t_0)$ or outside the half-plane $g_K(t_0)$. On the other hand we have $v_K^+(t) \in g_K(t_0)$. So the line $l_K(t_0)$ passes through the segment connecting $p$ and $v_K^+(t)$, and the intersection $v_K(t, t_0) = l_K(t) \cap l_K(t_0)$ is inside $T$. This with that the diameter of $T$ is less than $2 \epsilon$ proves $\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K(t, t') = v_K^+(t)$. □
