To prove the main [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]], we start with the simple bound of Gerver on the rotation angle $\omega$.

> __Lemma [rotation-angle-simple-bound].__ (Modification of p271, [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]) Let $S$ be any moving sofa of area $> 2.2$. Then $S$ admits a movement in $L$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (\sec^{-1}(2.2) , \pi/2]$. ^lem-rotation-angle-simple-bound

_Proof._ Assume any movement of $S$ inside $L$ with rotation angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. If $\omega \leq -\pi/4$, then by [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]] a translation of $S$ is a common subset of $H$ and $L_{-\pi/4}$, where $L_{-\pi/4}$ is a translation of $R_{-\pi/4}(L)$. The intersection of $H$ and $L_{-\pi/4}$ has area $\sqrt{2} = 1.4142\dots$ always, contradicting $|S| > 2.2$. If $|\omega| \leq \sec^{-1}(2.2)$, then by [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa#^pro-moving-sofa-common-subset]] a translation of $S$ is a common subset of $H$ and $V_\omega$. The intersection $H \cap V_\omega$ is then a parallelogram of area $\sec(\omega) \leq 2.2$, again contradicting $|S| > 2.2$. So we should have $\sec^{-1}(2.2) < \omega$.

Assume $\omega > \pi/2$, or otherwise we are done. We show that $S$ also admits another movement in $L$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$. Follow the movement of $S$ inside $L$ with rotation $\omega$ from the start, and stop in the middle where $S$ is rotated clockwise by exactly $\pi/2$. Call the copy of $S$ at this moment $S_{\pi/2}$. Translate $S_{\pi/2}$ horizontally in the positive direction of the $x$-axis, until it makes contact with the outer wall $x=1$ of $L$. Since $S$ is initially in $H_L$, the width of $S_{\pi/2}$ measured along the $x$-axis is at most one. So after the additional horizontal translation, $S_{\pi/2}$ lies completely inside $V_L$ with the rotation angle $\pi/2$. â–¡

We find two points $q_0, q_1 \in S_\omega$ sufficiently away from the origin. Then we take a tangent hallway $L_t$ of $S_\omega$ containing $S_\omega$ and thus the two points $q_0, q_1 \in S_\omega$ (dashed), so that $L_t$ is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$. ^fig-proof-outline

By [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^lem-rotation-angle-simple-bound]] and Gerver's sofa of area $|G| = 2.2195\dots > 2.2$, we can assume the rotation angle $\omega \in (\sec^{-1}(2.2), \pi/2]$ of a maximum-area moving sofa. As described at the end of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface]] and [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-triangle-full]], it suffices to show that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from the triangle $\Delta_\omega$ near $O$ with three vertices $O$, $o_\omega - (0, 1)$, and $o_\omega - (\cos \omega, \sin \omega)$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface#^thm-balanced-consumed]]). We sketch this main step of the proof of the main [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]].

Let $K$ be the cap of the monotone sofa $S_\omega$. We will find two points $q_0, q_1 \in S_\omega$ on the upper boundary of $K$ sufficiently away from $O$. Using that $K$ have area at least $2.2$, we first find $q_0 \in K$ on the $x$-axis sufficiently away from the origin $O$. Then we use a right triangle with the right-angled vertex $q_0$ and side 1 (green in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^fig-proof-outline]]), to find a lower bound $g$ (the base of the right triangle, which is blue in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^fig-proof-outline]]) of the horizontal side length of $S_\omega$ on the line $y = 0$. By the balancedness of $S_\omega$, the horizontal side length of $S_\omega$ on the line $y=1$ is also bounded from below by $g$. Define $q_1 \in K$ as the point exactly $g$ away from the endpoint $o_\omega$ on this side.

Now that we found two points $q_0, q_1 \in S_\omega$, we will take some tangent hallway $L_t$ of $S_\omega$ with a specific angle $t \in (0, \omega)$. Using that $L_t$ should contain the two points $q_0, q_1 \in S_\omega$ sufficiently away from $O$, we prove that $\Delta_\omega$ must be enclosed by the inner walls of $L_t$ as in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^fig-proof-outline]], showing that $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from $S_\omega \subset L_t$ as we wanted.
