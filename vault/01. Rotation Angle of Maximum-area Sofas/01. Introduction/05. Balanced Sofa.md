Another important idea of Gerver is that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\omega}$ with _balanced_ side lengths, stated as Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Analogously, Theorem 2 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] derives a sofa $G$ which also has balanced side lengths. While he does not show that $G$ indeed attains the maximum area, that $G$ is also balanced as a maximum-area sofa would suggests that $G$ is a good candidate for being optimum.

We will use the balancedness of maximum-area monotone sofa $S_\omega$ to prove the main [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]]. However, Gerver's proof of Theorem 1 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is flawed. For this reason, we will restate and prove the balancedness of $S_\omega$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]]. Here, we sketch the idea of Gerver, elaborate why his proof is flawed (which is very subtle), and sketch how we circumvent this in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]].

In the first paragraph of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], Gerver defines a sofa as a _connected_ planar region in the first paragraph. Then in the proof of Theorem 1, he defines a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of shapes in which he finds a balanced sofa $S_\omega$ of maximum area. However, he does not require the members of $\mathcal{T}$ to be connected; in fact, the connectedness condition is not mentioned at all in the rest of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].[^connected] So technically, it is not guaranteed that such $S_\omega$ he finds should be connected.

It is then natural to try to fix his argument by simply restricting the shapes in his argument to be connected. This will not work, and explaining why so requires a full sketch of his idea. Fix the rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Recall that in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa]], a moving sofa $S$ is identified as the intersection $\mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t$ of strips and rotating hallways. Take a finite nonempty subset $\Theta$ of $(0, \omega)$ and the polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
S_\Theta := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_t
$$
as the approximation of $\mathcal{I}$. The approximated problem now is to maximize the area of $S_\Theta$ by translating the finite number of hallways $L_t$ each rotated counterclockwise by $t \in \Theta$.

Gerver's proof of Theorem 1 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] proceeds by taking a sequence $S_{\Theta_1}, S_{\Theta_2}, \dots$ of polygon intersections in [[#^eqn-polygon]] of maximum area, in which the angle set $\Theta = \Theta_n$ becomes denser in $[0, \omega]$.[^detail-one] Say that the polygon $S_\Theta$ is _balanced_ if for any unit vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the sum of the lengths of edges of $S_\Theta$ of the normal vector $v$ is equal to that of the opposite normal vector $-v$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].[^balanced] He reasons that a maximum-area polygon $S_\Theta$ in [[#^eqn-polygon]] should be balanced. Otherwise, we could push one of the $H$, $V_\omega$ or $L_t$ by a small distance in a direction orthogonal to the unbalanced side lengths and increase the area slightly, and if we pushed either $H$ or $V_\omega$, translate the whole $S_\Theta$ to move $H$ or $V_\omega$ back to its position.[^detail-two] 

This reasoning, that a polygon $S_\Theta$ in [[#^eqn-polygon]] of maximum area is balanced, breaks when we require the shapes to be connected. As we require $S_\Theta$ to be connected, we allow the possibility that the maximum-area $S_\Theta$ is _not_ balanced, as any balancing move on $S_\Theta$ that increases the area as described by Gerver will immediately make the new $S_\Theta$ disconnected.

For an example, assume the case $\omega = \pi/2$ and $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/4 \right\}$, so that we maximize the intersection $H \cap L_{\pi/4}$ where $L_{\pi/4}$ is rotated by $\pi/4$ then translated. The maximum-area connected intersection happens when the inner corner of $L_{\pi/4}$ is at $(0, 1)$, and some perturbation of $L_{\pi/4}$ indeed leads to disconnected intersection. In this case, we were lucky enough that the intersection $H \cap L_{\pi/4}$ is balanced in the beginning. But note that Gerver's balancing argument did not contribute in showing the balancedness.

We fill this gap in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] and rigorously establish the existence of a balanced maximum-area monotone sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$. Instead of requring the polygonal approximation $S_{\Theta}$ to be connected, we will write $S_\Theta = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ as the difference of a polygon cap $K$ and polygon niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, analogous to the (continuous) cap $K$ and niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ of a monotone sofa $S$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa]]. Then we will maximize the value $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K) := |K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$ with respect to the polygon cap $K$, regardless of whether $S_{\Theta} = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is connected or whether $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \subset K$. We show that the maximizer $K_\Theta$ is balanced in the sense that the sum of side lengths of $K$ and $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}(K)$ balance with each other.

> __Theorem [maximum-polygon-cap-abridged].__ (abridged) A polygon cap $K_\Theta := K$ maximizing $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K) := |K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$ exists ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Balanced Polygon Cap#^thm-maximum-polygon-cap]]) and is always balanced ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Balanced Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]]), in the sense that the side lengths of $K$ and $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ balance each other ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Balanced Polygon Cap#^def-polygon-cap-balanced]]). ^thm-maximum-polygon-cap-abridged

Then we show that for such $K_\Theta$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-maximum-polygon-cap-abridged]] we have $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K_\Theta) \subset K_\Theta$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Balanced Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa-connected]]). Using this, we will show that as $\Theta$ gets denser in $[0,\omega]$, the maximum polygon cap $K_\Theta$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-maximum-polygon-cap-abridged]] indeed converge to a monotone sofa attaining the maximum area with the fixed rotation angle $\omega$.

> __Theorem [maximum-area-polygon-limit].__ (abridged) For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, there exists a monotone sofa $S_\omega$ satisfying the followings. ^thm-maximum-area-polygon-limit
> 
> 1. $S_\omega$ attains the maximum area among all moving sofas of rotation angle $\omega$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-sofa]]).
> 2. As $n \to \infty$, there is a sequence of finite sets $\Theta_n \subset (0, \omega)$ getting denser in $[0, \omega]$, so that the balanced polygon caps $K_{\Theta_n}$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-maximum-polygon-cap-abridged]] converge to the cap $K_\omega$ of $S_\omega$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-balanced-maximum-cap]]).

[^connected]: Note that a lot of work in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]] and [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] is done to ensure the connectedness of a maximum-shape we find.

[^balanced]: Gerver's definition of balancedness in page 268 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] also require the parallel sides of opposite directions to have distance 1. But this does not make difference for $S_\Theta$ as the parallel sides of opposite directions in $S_\Theta$ always have distance 1 by definition.

[^detail-one]: The polygon $S_{\Theta_n}$ is defined as $P_n$ in the first paragraph of page 272 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].

[^detail-two]: This balancing argument on $S_{\Theta}$ (or $P_n$ in his paper) is done in the second paragrpah of page 273 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].
