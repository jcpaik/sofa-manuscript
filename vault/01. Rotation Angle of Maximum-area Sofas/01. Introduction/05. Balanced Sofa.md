Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] states that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\omega}$ with _balanced_ side lengths. This theorem is important, and we will use it in the proof of the main [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] and the upcoming works. However, we will see that Gerver's proof of Theorem 1 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] needs further logical considerations. For this, [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] reworks the proof and rigorously show the [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]] and [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-balanced-maximum-cap]] that implies Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].

# Balancing Argument

We first outline the statement of Theorem 1 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Fix the rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Recall that, as described in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa]], a moving sofa $S$ is essentially a connected intersection $\mathcal{I} := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t$ of strips and rotating hallways. Discretize the problem by taking a finite nonempty subset $\Theta$ of $(0, \omega)$ and the finite polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
S_\Theta := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_t
$$
instead. The approximated problem now is to maximize the area of $S_\Theta$ by translating the finite number of hallways $L_t$ each rotated counterclockwise by $t \in \Theta$.

Say that the polygon $S_\Theta$ is _balanced_ if for any unit vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the sum of the lengths of edges of $S_\Theta$ of the normal vector $v$ is equal to that of the opposite normal vector $-v$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].[^balanced] Gerver's idea is that a maximum-area polygon $S_\Theta$ in [[#^eqn-polygon]] should be balanced. Otherwise, we could push one of the $H$, $V_\omega$ or $L_t$ by a small distance in a direction orthogonal to the unbalanced side lengths and increase the area slightly, and if we pushed either $H$ or $V_\omega$, translate the whole $S_\Theta$ to move $H$ or $V_\omega$ back to its position.[^balancing-where]

As the angle set $\Theta$ becomes denser in $[0, \omega]$, by appealing to a compactness argument, there is a sequence of such maximal polygons $S_\Theta$ that converges to some maximum-area moving sofa $S_\omega$. This is the Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. We copy the statement from [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] verbatim for readers to compare (footnotes ours).

> *Theorem 1.* There exists a real number $\gamma$, $\pi/3 \leq \gamma \leq \pi/2$, and a region $S$, such that $S$ can move around the corner of $H$,[^hallway-notation] rotating through an angle of $-\gamma$ in the process,[^rotation-angle] such that no region of greater area can move around the corner, and such that for arbitrarily large $n$, $S$ can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a polygonal region $P_n$ with the following properties:[^balancing-where] The boundary of $P_n$ is a balanced polygon. $P_n$ is the intersection of $n+1$ sets $H_\alpha$ (where $\alpha = k \gamma/n$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$). $H_0$ is the half-strip $x \leq 1$, $0 \leq y \leq 1$. $H_\gamma$ is a translation of the half strip $\gamma \leq 1$, $0 \leq x \leq 1$ rotated by angle $\gamma$. For $0 < \alpha < \gamma$, $H_\alpha$ is a translation of $H$ rotated by angle $\gamma$.

# Logical Gap in the Balancing Argument

The subtle logical gap in the proof of Theorem 1 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] comes from the connectedness of sofas. In the first paragraph of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], Gerver defines a moving sofa as a _connected_ planar region. However, neither the connectedness of the polygons $S_\Theta$ nor the limiting shape $S_\omega$ are addressed in the proof of Theorem 1. In fact, the connectedness condition is not mentioned at all in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] after the definition of a sofa.[^connected-comparsion]

To fill this gap, it is reasonable to simply take $S_\Theta$ as the maximum-area polygon _among_ connected intersections and check that Gerver's proof still works. This is natural, as if each polygon $S_\Theta$ can be disconnected, proving that the limit $S_\omega$ is connected would require extra work. However, simply requiring each $S_\Theta$ to be connected will not work as well. The balancing argument cannot guarantee that a maximum-area _connected_ polygon $S_\Theta$ should be balanced. See the following example.

(See [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa#^fig-balancing-progress]]) Take a sufficiently small positive real number $\epsilon > 0$. Define unit vector $\mathbf{u} = (\sqrt{3}/2, 1/2)$. Take the angle set $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/3, \pi/6 \right\}$ and rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$, and the hallways $L_{\pi/6}$, $L_{\pi/3}$ with inner corners $\mathbf{x}(\pi/6) = (0, 1) - \epsilon  \mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{x}(\pi/3) = (-0.9, 0.98)$. The intersection $S_\Theta$ as in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa#^eqn-polygon]] is not balanced, as the side with normal angle $+ \mathbf{u}$ is always larger than the side with normal angle $-\mathbf{u}$ (depicted green). The balancing argument will now push $L_{\pi/6}$ in the positive direction of $\mathbf{u}$. But note that this will decrease $\epsilon$ until it hits $\epsilon = 0$, and the intersection $S_\Theta$ is still not balanced in the direction of $\mathbf{u}$. Now, any further balancing moves in the direction of $\mathbf{u}$ will break the connectivity of $S_\Theta$. So the balancing argument cannot guarantee that the balancedness of a maximum-area _connected_ polygon $S_\Theta$.

> ![](images/balancingProgress.svg)

Thus, while a polygon $S_\Theta$ allowed to be disconnected must be balanced, a polygon $S_\Theta$ that _should_ be connected may not be balanced. In the example above, it is possible to balance $S_\Theta$ while preserving the connectedness in fact. However, to do so we need to take the direction of the balancing carefully. This extra consideration is not addressed in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].

# Filling the Gap in the Balancing Argument

We fill this gap in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] and rigorously establish the existence of a balanced maximum-area monotone sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$.

To do so, instead of requring the polygon $S_{\Theta}$ to be connected, we will write $S_\Theta = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ as the difference of a polygon cap $K$ and polygon niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, analogous to the (continuous) cap $K$ and niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ of a monotone sofa $S$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa]]. Then we will maximize the value $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K) := |K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$ with respect to the polygon cap $K$, regardless of whether $S_{\Theta} = K \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is connected or whether $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is contained in $K$. 

We will then show that the maximizer $K_\Theta$ is balanced ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]]), which means that the side lengths of $K$ and $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ balance each other ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^def-polygon-cap-balanced]]). Then we will show that for such $K_\Theta$ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa#^thm-maximum-polygon-cap-abridged]] we always have $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K_\Theta) \subset K_\Theta$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa-connected]]), which is not trivial. Using this, we will show that as $\Theta$ gets denser in $[0,\omega]$, the maximum polygon cap $K_\Theta$ in indeed converge to a monotone sofa $S_\omega$ attaining the maximum area with the fixed rotation angle $\omega$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-sofa]]), which is equivalent to the Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].

[^balanced]: Gerver's definition of balancedness in page 268 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] also require the parallel sides of opposite directions to have distance 1. But this does not make difference for $S_\Theta$ as the parallel sides of opposite directions in $S_\Theta$ always have distance 1 by definition.

[^balancing-where]: The polygon $S_{\Theta_n}$ is defined as $P_n$ in the first paragraph of page 272 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. The balancing argument on $S_{\Theta}$ (or $P_n$ in his paper) is done in the second paragraph of page 273 in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992].

[^hallway-notation]: This $H$ in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is the hallway $L$ in our paper.

[^rotation-angle]: This $\gamma$ in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is the rotation angle $\omega$ in our paper.

[^connected-comparsion]: In comparsion, a lot of work in the [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]] and [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] are done to ensure the connectedness of a maximum-area intersection we find.
