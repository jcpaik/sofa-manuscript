Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L := H_L \cup V_L$ of its _horizontal side_ $H_L := (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $V_L := [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $H_L$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $V_L$. ^def-moving-sofa

The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \alpha_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that there is a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @croft2012unsolved]. Specifically, Gerver conjectured that his sofa $G$ _is_ the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ and thus the equality $\alpha_{\max} = \alpha_G$ holds at the lower bound [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Numerical experimentations support $S_{\max} = S_G$.[^numerical] Romik [@romik] derived Gerver's sofa $G$ as a candidate of $S_{\max}$ under the following assumptions.

1. $S_{\max}$ rotates clockwise by $\pi/2$ during its movement in $L$.
2. $S_{\max}$ is symmetric along the $y$-axis.
3. The full movement of $S_{\max}$ in $L$ consists of five stages of differentiable movements, in each $S$ makes contact with a specific set of the walls and the inner corner $(0, 0)$ of $L$.

However, all of the assumptions above on $S_{\max}$ remain unproven, leaving $S_{\max} = S_G$ still open to this date.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $H_L$ to $V_L$ inside $L$. ^def-rotation-angle

The first assumption that a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ have rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ seems indispensable in establishing or at least convincing $S_{\max} = S_G$. In [@romik], Romik writes that $\omega = \pi/2$ "seems extremely plausible", and in [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018], Romik and Kallus writes that $\omega = \pi/2$ "may well be true even if Gerverâ€™s conjecture is false". However, a moving sofa may rotate less than $\pi/2$ in its full movement (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-clipped-sofa]]). In [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], Gerver derives his sofa $G$ only for the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ without further justification, although the same calculation could be done for $\omega < \pi/2$ as well.

In summary, all known derivations of Gerver's sofa depends on the following [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]].

> __Conjecture [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with rotation angle $\pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Figure [clipped-sofa].__ For any $\omega < \pi/2$ sufficiently close to $\pi/2$, take the intersection $S_{\text{max}} \cap V_\omega$ of the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ and the rotated vertical strip $V_\omega$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^def-strips]]). Then the intersection is a moving sofa sufficiently close to $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$. ^fig-clipped-sofa

As a progress towards [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]], Gerver showed in 1992 that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. His argument, reproduced later in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^lem-rotation-angle-simple-bound]], can actually prove a slightly improved lower bound $\omega \geq \sec^{-1}(2.2) = 62.96\cdots\degree$. In 2018, Kallus and Romik further improved the lower bound to $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ with computer assistance [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. The full equality $\omega = \pi/2$, however, is difficult to show with their methods as there is a moving sofa sufficiently close to the optimum sofa $S_{\max}$ in its area, shape, and rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$ (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-clipped-sofa]]).

We prove [[#^con-angle]] in this paper. Our proof does not rely on computer assistance, except for numerical computations that can be done on a scientific calculator.

> __Theorem [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^thm-angle

In [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]], we first restrict the kinds of sofas to _monotone sofas_ that are the intersection of rotating hallways in convex position (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/03. Monotone Sofa]] for details). In [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]], we revisit an important theorem of Gerver stating some maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\omega}$ with rotation angle $\omega$ is a limit of polygons with _balanced_ side lengths (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa]] for details). In particular, we address logical gaps in his proof and restate the theorem in our terminology. In [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface]], we use the monotonicity and balancedness of $S_\omega$ to show that that $S_\omega$ also admits a movement of rotation angle $\pi/2$ inside $L$, proving [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]].

> __Definition [strips].__ Define the horizontal strip $H := \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, vertical strip $V := [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$, and its rotation $V_\omega$ around the origin by a counterclockwise angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-strips

> __Definition [parallelogram].__ Let $O = (0, 0)$ be the origin. For any angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, define $P_\omega := H \cap V_\omega$ and $o_\omega := (\tan(\omega/2), 1)$. ^def-parallelogram

The main step for proving [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface]] is to show that a triangular region $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from the maximum-area monotone sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [\sec^{-1}(2.2), \pi/2]$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface#^thm-balanced-consumed]]). The monotone sofa $S_\omega$ is always inscribed in the parallelogram $P_\omega$ of width 1 with lower-left corner $O$ and upper-right corner $o_\omega$, making an angle of $\pi/2 + \omega$ at both corners (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-triangle-full]]). The region $\Delta_\omega$ is defined as the triangular region near $O$ formed by three vertices $O$, $o_\omega - (0, 1)$, and $o_\omega - (\cos \omega, \sin \omega)$. To show that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$, we use the balancedness of $S_\omega$ established in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] to find a rotated hallway $L_t$ that contains $S$ but is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$. See [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem#^fig-proof-outline]] and [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/07. Proof of the Main Theorem]] for a detailed outline of this step.

Once we show that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$, as $S_\omega \subseteq P_\omega \setminus \Delta_\omega$ it has enough room to rotate _counterclockwise_ by an angle of $\pi/2 - \omega$ inside the horizontal side $H_L$. Follow this rotation of $S_\omega$ in $H_L$ in reverse so that it rotates _clockwise_ by $\pi/2 - \omega$, and then follow the original movement of $S_\omega$ in $L$, to find the movement of a rotated copy of $S_\omega$ with the full rotation angle $\pi/2$. This will show $|S_\omega| \leq |S_{\pi/2}|$ and thus [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]].

> __Figure [triangle-full].__ The moving sofa $S_\omega$ of maximum area with a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ is inscribed in $P_\omega$ and disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$ (left). So it can rotate counterclockwise by the angle of $\pi/2-\omega$ inside the horizontal side $H_L$ (right). ^fig-triangle-full

[^sofa-translation]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate it at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]]eface#^fig-gerver]]]).

[^sofa-closed]: Taking the closure of a movable set $S$ does not hurt the movability.

[^numerical]: Approximate solutions found by Gibbs [@gibbsComputationalStudySofas2014] in 2014 and Batsch [@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022] in 2022 deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.
