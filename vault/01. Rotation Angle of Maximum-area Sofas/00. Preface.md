The _moving sofa problem_ asks for the connected shape with the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. It is conjectured that Gerver's sofa $G$ attains the maximum area, but all known derivations of $G$ assumes without proof that a maximum-area sofa should rotate clockwise by $\pi/2$ in its movement. We prove this assumption in this paper. We use an important theorem of Gerver that there exists a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ which is the limit of polygons with balanced side lengths. We address subtle yet crucial logical gaps in his proof, restate the theorem in our terminology, and prove it rigorously filling out the logical gap.
