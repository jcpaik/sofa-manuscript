The _moving sofa problem_ asks for the connected shape with the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. It is conjectured that Gerver's sofa $S_G$ attains the maximum area, but all known derivations of $S_G$ assumes without proof that a maximum-area sofa should rotate clockwise by $\pi/2$ in its movement. We prove this assumption in this paper.
