Differential calculation makes it so easier to navigate Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals/measures.

$df$

But it also leads to one hell of a confusion. What does $\sigma_K(dt)$ exactly mean???
This should mean the same measure $\sigma_K$ on the differential $d t$.

The core issue is that for a measure $u$, the 'value' of $u$ at a single value $t$ is not well-defined.

So the notion $\sigma_K(dt)$ should be taken the very same as $\sigma_K$.
