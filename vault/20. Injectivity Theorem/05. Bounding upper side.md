Limiting theorem
Balancedness

Want:
- polygonal interesections, each balanced, containing the desired angels
- limit theorem
- conclusion: left gap/right gap upper bound

> __Lemma [maximum-balanced-sofa-edge].__ Let $S_i$ be a monotone hallway intersection with cap $K_i$ that attains the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_{\Theta_i}$. Then $S_i$ is balanced. ^lem-maximum-balanced-sofa-edge

_Proof._ We only need to verify that $S_i$ is an intersection of hallways, and that pertubing the hallways does not make the intersection discontinuous (is still a hallway intersection). 
As $S_i$ is monotone (cap minus niche inside cap), it is continuous and the full intersection of hallways.
Perturb each hallway a bit. The 'cap' part changes its shape by epsilon, and

> __Definition [minimum-gap].__ For any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$, define $w_K^\circ = \min_{t \in [0, \omega]} w_K(t)$ and $z_K^\circ = \min_{t \in [0, \omega)} z_K(t)$.  ^def-minimum-gap

> __Theorem [maximum-balanced-sofa-edge].__ For the maximum area sofa $S$ in [[05. Bounding upper side#^thm-maximum-balanced-sofa]], we have the followings: if $\omega = \pi/2$, then the distance between $A^-_K(\pi/2)$ and $C^+_K(0)$ is at least $w_K^\circ + z_K^\circ$. If $\omega < \pi/2$, then the distance between $A^-_K(\omega)$ and $p_\omega$ is at least $z_K^\circ$, and the distance between $C^+_K(0)$ and $p_\omega$ is at least $w_K^\circ$. ^thm-maximum-balanced-sofa-edge


_Proof._ Because each $S_i$ is balanced, we have $\omega_{K_i}^\circ = \min_{t \in \Theta_i} w_{K_i}(t) \leq (C_{K_i}^+(0) - p_\omega) \cdot v_{\omega}$.   
Say on contrary that $\omega_{K}^\circ > something$. Then by the definition of $\omega_K^\circ (t) > some$ 

OK. Seems easier to go the other route: For any finite balanced intersection, the gap of the upper edge has to be at least some value. THEN send the limit.

Let $S$ be a sofa of maximum area in the gap xx.
