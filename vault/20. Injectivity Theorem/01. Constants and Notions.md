In this section, we fix the following constants.

We first choose specific angle sets $\Theta^{*n}$ with rotation angle $\pi / 2$ of size $n + 1$ where $n = 5, 6, 7$. The $n$ denotes the number of intervals involved in $\Theta^{*n}$, so the size should be one more than that. We choose the angles $t$ so that the coordinates of $u_t$ and $v_t$ are rational, in order for the computations to be exact. 
We ensure that $\theta^{*n}_j = \pi / 2 - \theta^{*n}_{n - j}$ for every $j < n / 2$. When $n$ is even, we let $\theta_{n/2}^{*n}$ to be a close approximation of $\pi/4$.

$\Theta^{*5}$ is the angle set with the following angles.
$$
\begin{align*}
\arctan(\theta_1^{*5}) & = 5/12 \\
\arctan(\theta_2^{*5}) & = 3/4
\end{align*}
$$

Often times, we will fix an angle set $\Theta^{*n}$ and an arbitrary cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\Theta^{*n}}$. Under such context, we simplify the notions for the edges and vertices of the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(K)$ as the following. For edges $?=a,b,c,d$ and corners $? = \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$, we denote $?_K(\theta^{*n}_i)$ as simply $?_{i}$. For example, $a_i = a_{K}(\theta^{*n}_{i})$. 
The notion $A_i$ means the intersection of lines $a_i$ and $a_{i-1}$. 
The notion $C_i$ means the intersection of lines $c_i$ and $c_{i+1}$.
