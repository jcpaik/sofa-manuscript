Our goal here is to show that, if there is a sufficiently many angle (about 7) in the hallway intersection, then the monotone hallway intersection should be a balanced polygon. We do this because it can be possible that a perturbation of monotone hallway intersection may not be connected. The main theorem here guarantee that a perturbation is still connected, so is a monotone hallway intersection.

> __Lemma [edge-in-triangle].__ Let $K$ be any cap with angle set $\Theta$. Let $t_1 < t_2 < t_3 < t_4$ be four triangles in $\Theta$. Then for any $t \in [t_2, t_3]$, the edge $e_K(t)$ is inside the triangle with vertices $v_K(t_1, t_2)$, $v_K(t_2, t_3)$ and $v_K(t_3, t_4)$. ^lem-edge-in-triangle

In this section, fix the following parameters of angles.

Also, fix an arbitrary monotone hallway intersection $S$ with angle set $\Theta$ and cap $K$. 

> __Lemma [inner-corner-strictly-in-cap].__ Let $c = 0.2$. For any index $i$, the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_i$ . That is, $\mathbf{x}_{i} \cdot u_j \leq p_K(\theta_j) - c$ holds for any $i$ and $j$. ^lem-inner-corner-strictly-in-cap

> __Theorem [inner-corner-strictly-in-cap].__ For any moving sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega \in [\pi/2 - c, \pi]$, the distance between $\mathbf{x}_K$ and the upper boundary $\partial K$ of cap is at least $0.1$. ^thm-inner-corner-strictly-in-cap

_Proof._ Use the lemma above, and that $\mathbf{x}$ is Lipschitz. â–¡
