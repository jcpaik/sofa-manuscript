Below is a sketch of the proof of the injectivity hypothesis ([[01. Injectivity Hypothesis and A1#^con-injectivity]]) in planing. The proof is still being finalized, but upon completion we will publish it as a new paper in the series. 
From now on, assume a monotone sofa $S$ with cap $K$ 

# Injectivity Hypothesis on a Small Interval

Let us first try to prove the injectivity of $\mathbf{x}_K$ on a small fixed interval $[\theta_1, \theta_2]$. It is sufficient to provide a constant, nonzero vector $\mathbf{v}$ so that $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot \mathbf{v} > 0$ for any $t \in [\theta_1, \theta_2]$. That is, $\mathbf{x}_K$ strictly moves towards the direction of $\mathbf{v}$. Using [[03. Space of Caps#^thm-inner-corner-deriv]], this is equivalent to showing
$$
-(g_K^+(t) - 1) (u_t \cdot \mathbf{v}) + (h_K^+(t) - 1) (v_t \cdot \mathbf{v}) > 0
$$
for all $t \in [\theta_1, \theta_2]$. Then the values $u_t \cdot \mathbf{v}$ and $v_t \cdot \mathbf{v}$ are effectively bounded using only $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, and the question reduces to bounding the arm lengths $g_K^+(t)$ and $h_K^+(t)$ on the interval $[\theta_1, \theta_2]$.
# Finite upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ and software `SofaDesigner`

Let $S$ be a monotone sofa of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$.
Let $\Theta$ be a finite partition of $[0, \omega]$.
Then the finite intersection $H \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_S(t)$ has an area at least $S$, so it has area at least that of Gerver's sofa in particular.
`SofaDesigner` analyzes this intersection. In details:

The finite intersection is controlled by the inner corners $\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}_S(t_i)$.
Let $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ be the area of this finite intersection. Then $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ is a piecewise quadratic function with each piece being polytope.
`SofaDesigner` computes $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ symbolically using a custom branch-and-bound algorithm and exact rational quadratic programming.
By a method of contradiction, `SofaDesigner` can bound linear combinations of $\mathbf{x}_i$ effectively.

# Injectivity Theorem on large subinterval.

We outline a proof of injectivity hypothesis using `SofaDesigner`. 
For a reason we will explain later, `SofaDesigner` is only able to prove the theorem for smaller interval $I = [\theta_1, \theta_{n-1}]$ of $[0, \pi/2]$.
We separate the proof into the _local_ injectivity and the _global_ injectivity. 

We show the _local_ injectivity, that $\mathbf{x}$ is injective on $[\theta_{i}, \theta_{i+2}]$.  This is done by locating some constant vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ so that $\mathbf{x}' \cdot \mathbf{v}_i > 0$ for the interval.
The value $\mathbf{x}'$ is expressed in terms of $h^+$ and $g^+$, and they are bounded by some value depending only on the values $\theta_i$ and $\theta_{i+1}$.
That value is bounded by `SofaDesigner`. 

We show thte global injectivity that $\mathbf{x}$ does not overlap on $\leq \theta_i$ and $\theta \geq \theta_{i+2}$. This is done by locating some constant vector $\mathbf{w}_i$ so that separating plane...

From the constrained injectivity theorem, we only get an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_{1}^{p, q}$. Fortunately this is also a proper quadratic functional on the cap space.

# Extending the proof to all intervals

It is hard because it's hard to control $g^+$ and $h^+$ near 0. There are approximations of Gerver's sofa with $g^+$ and $h^+$ drastically different from Gerver's.
However, we can control the values of $g^+$ and $h^+$ using _balancedness_ of a maximum sofa.
It is a concept introduced by Gerver to derive the sofa. 
In particular, it is needed to bound the upper edge of $K$. The upper edge is at least the sum of the left and right segment of the bottom gaps.

Left gap $q_K$ and right gap $r_K$.

The lower bounds' gap are provided again by `SofaDesigner` (how?)
OR, provided by solving a quadratic programming on $\mathcal{A}_1^{p, q}$.

So we can control $g^+$ on the boundaries as well, proving the injectivity hypothesis
