We use the notations in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/04. Notations/00. Preface]]. We summarize the definitions concisely. See [[a. Angle Hypothesis/04. Notations/00. Preface]] for full details of the definition.

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a Borel measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively.

The set $S^1$ denotes $\mathbb{R}$ modulo $2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $\mu_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $\nu_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$.

A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. For any convex body $K$, its _support function_ $h_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $h_S(t) := \sup \left\{ s \cdot \mu_t : s \in S \right\}$. The _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is the intersection $K \cap l_K(t)$.

> __Definition [surface-area-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, denote its _surface area measure_ on $S^1$ (defined in p214 of [[@schneider_2013]], and also denoted as $S_1(K, -)$ or $S_K$ in p464 of [[@schneider_2013]]) as $\sigma_K$. For any $t \in S^1$, denote $\sigma_K\left( \left\{ t \right\} \right)$ as simply $\sigma_K(t)$. ^def-surface-area-measure

For any convex body $K$, the surface area measure $\sigma_K$ measures the side lengths of $K$. If $K$ is a convex polygon, then $\sigma_K$ is a discrete measure such that the measure $\sigma_K\left( t \right)$ at point $t$ is the length of the edge $e_K(t)$. For another example of $\sigma_K$, assume $K$ is a smooth convex polygon where for every $t \in S^1$, the tangent line $l_K(t)$ always meets $K$ at a single point $v(t) = v_K^{\pm}(t)$ which is smooth in $t \in S^1$. Then it turns out that $\sigma_K$ have distribution function $R : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ where $R(t) = \left\lVert v'(t) \right\rVert$ is the radius of curvature of $\partial K$ at $v(t)$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-side-length].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, $\sigma_K(t)$ is the length of the edge $e_K(t)$. Consequently, $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t) + \sigma_K(t) \nu_t$. ^thm-surface-area-measure-side-length

_Proof._ Apply Theorem 4.2.3 of [[@schneider_2013]] to the Borel subset $\left\{ t \right\}$ of $S^1$. â–¡
