Define the angle set $\Theta_7$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ of size 8 as the following. Here, the index 7 denotes the number of intervals that the partition $\Theta_7$ gives. The set $\Theta_7$ contains the angles $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_7 = \pi/2$. We have $t_{7-i} = \pi / 2 - t_i$ for every $0 \leq i \leq 3$. The angles $t_1, t_2, t_3$ are determined by the following.

$$
\begin{align*}
\arctan(\theta_1^{*5}) & = 5/12 \\
\arctan(\theta_2^{*5}) & = 3/4
\end{align*}
$$

In this section, $K$ is always an arbitrary cap with rotation angle $\pi/2$ and angle set $\Theta_7$. Simplify the notions for the edges and vertices of the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(K)$ as the following. For edges $?=a,b,c,d$ and corners $? = \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$, denote $?_K(t_i)$ as simply $?_{i}$. For example, $a_i = a_{K}(t_i)$. The vertex $A_i$ is the intersection of lines $a_i$ and $a_{i-1}$, so that the right part of the upper boundary of $K$ consists of the vertices $A_0, A_1, \dots, A_n$. The notion $C_i$ is the intersection of lines $c_i$ and $c_{i+1}$. So the left part of the upper boundary of $K$ consists of the vertices $C_0, C_1, \dots, C_n$.
