While I did my best to avoid collisions in symbols, that is, an unfortunate situation where the same letter denoting different meaning, some compromise had to be made.

The general principle is that, a decorated superscript may mean completely different thing. A subscript will determine the thing. Some symbol with/without subscript may mean a similar thing or completely different thing. 

- $l(t, h)$ is the line determined by two parameters $t \in S^1$ and $h \in \mathbb{R}$.
- $l_K$ is the supporting line determined by $K$.
- $l_0$ may denote some specific line in a proof.
