The _moving sofa problem_ asks for the connected shape $S_{\text{max}}$ with the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. It has been known that $S_{\text{max}}$ is the intersection of hallways $L_t$ rotated by angle $t$ with position $\mathbf{x}(t)$, which was used to derive Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of potentially maximum area.

A major obstacle for the moving sofa problem is that, there is not a tractable formula that represents the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ as a function of $\mathbf{x}$. In this paper, we show that a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ of the maximum area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ satisfies a technical property that enables us to write a large portion of $S_{\max}$ via Green's theorem. This is a part of a bigger project. 

# Introduction

Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \alpha_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\text{max}}$ exists. In particular, [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/00. Preface]] showed that there is a maximum-area sofa which is both _monotone_ and _balanced_. A sofa is _monotone_ if it is the intersection of rotated hallways.


in convex position; that is, the outer walls of rotating hallways form the supporting lines of a convex body $K$. A monotone sofa can be built from $K$, called the _cap_ of $S$, by removing the portion of $K$ carved out by the inner corner.

A sofa is _balanced_ if it is the limit of balanced polygons.

One major challenge in solving the moving sofa problem exactly, is that there is no definite formula of the area of the sofa (with respect to $\mathbf{x}(t)$) to begin with. A pontential formula will change for each contact point. Gerver and Romik makes an assumption that a moving sofa of maximum area follows five stages in the beginning, to be able to execute a local optimization.

It is plausible that a maximum-area moving sofa is at least sufficiently close to Gerver's sofa, and that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ has no self-intersection. Once this is done, the area carved out by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is expressible using Green's theorem, so that it is more prone to optimization techniques. We indeed show that a maximum-area sofa has no self-intersection.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ A limiting maximum monotone sofa $S$ have $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of no self-intersection. ^thm-injectivity

This is related to an assumption of Romik (the first condition of 'well-behaved' in p321 of [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]) that he used to derive Gerver's sofa $S_G$.

> __Theorem [well-behaved].__ A limiting maximum monotone sofa $S$. Then the rotation path $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is continuously differentiable with respect to $t$, and it satisfies $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot \mu_t > 0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot \nu_t < 0$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$. ^thm-well-behaved

We show this by one-sided balancedness that holds no matter the contact types are.
