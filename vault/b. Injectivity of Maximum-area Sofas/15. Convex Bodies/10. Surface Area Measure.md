Recall that for any $K \in \mathcal{K}$, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is right-continuous with respect to $t \in S^1$ by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Notations/00. Preface#^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex]]. The map $t \mapsto v_K^+(t)$ is also of bounded variation, so $\mathrm{d} v_K^+(t)$, the pair of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures, exists.

> __Lemma [vertex-bounded-variation].__ For any $K \in \mathcal{K}$ and any interval $[a, b]$ of $S^1$, the function $v_K^+ : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is of bounded variation. ^lem-vertex-bounded-variation

_Proof._ For the interval $t \in [0, \pi/4]$, observe that the $x$-coordinate (resp. $y$-coordinate) of $v_K^+(t)$ decreases (resp. increases) with respect to $t$, so $v_K^+$ is of bounded variation on $[0, \pi/4]$. A similar logic can be used to angles $[\pi/4, \pi/2]$, $[\pi/2, 3\pi/4]$, and $[3\pi/4, 2\pi]$. Any larger domain $[a, b]$ of $t$ can be divided into subitervals of such intervals. □

We show the following [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^thm-boundary-measure]] that evaluates $\mathrm{d} v_K^{\pm}(t)$ in terms of the surface area measure $\sigma_K$ of $K$.

$$
> of pairs of measures on $I$ holds, where $v_K^+(t) : I \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and $v_t : I \to \mathbb{R}^2$ are taken as functions of $t \in I$.

Note that $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_t$ denote different things: $v_K^+(t)$ is a vertex of a convex body $K$, while $v_t$ is the unit vector $(\cos t, \sin t)$ independent of $K$. The consequence of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^thm-boundary-measure]] is that we have
$$
\int_{t \in I} p(t) \cdot d v_K^+(t) = \int_{t \in I} (p(t) \cdot v_t) \,\sigma(dt)
$$
for any bounded measurable function $p : I \to \mathbb{R}^2$.

_Proof._ (of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^thm-boundary-measure]]) It suffices to check that the pairs of measures $\mathrm{d} v_K^{+}(t)$ and $u_t \, \sigma$ agree on the subset $(a, x]$ of $I$ for any $x \in I$. That is, we only need to check ^eqn-boundary-to-check
$$
v_K^+(x) - v_K^+(a) = \int_{t \in (a, x]} v_t\,\sigma_K(dt).
$$

We first show [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] for polygon $K$. For polygon $K$, the measure $\sigma_K$ is a discrete measure where each proper edge $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t$ corresponds to a point mass of $\sigma_K$ concentrated at $t$ with the weight $\sigma_K(t)$ equal to the length of $e_K(t)$. So the right-hand side of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] is the sum of all vectors $v_t \sigma_K\left( \left\{ t \right\} \right) = v_K^+(t) - v_K^-(t)$ over all normal angles $t \in (a, x]$ of proper edges of $K$. The telescopic sum now gives the left-hand side $v_K^+(x) - v_K^+(a)$ as we desire.

Now we prove [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] for general convex body $K$. As in the proof of Theorem 8.3.3, page 466 of [[@schneider_2013]], we can take a series $K_1, K_2, \dots$ of polygons converging to $K$ in the Hausdorff distance $d_\mathrm{H}$ such that $e_{K_n}(a) = e_{K}(a)$ and $e_{K_n}(x) = e_{K}(x)$ for all $n \geq 1$. By Theorem 4.2.1, page 212 of [[@schneider_2013]], the measure $\sigma_{K_n}$ on $S^1$ converges to $\sigma_K$ weakly as $n \to \infty$.

For any measure $\sigma$ on $S^1$, define the _restriction_ $\sigma|_A$ of $\sigma$ to a Borel subset $A \subseteq S^1$ as the measure on $S^1$ such that $\sigma|_A(X) = \sigma(A \cap X)$ for all Borel subset $X \subseteq S^1$. Define $U$ as the open set $S^1 \setminus \left\{ a, x \right\}$ of $S^1$, and $V$ as the open interval $(a, x)$ of $S^1$. Define $u_n$ and $u$ as the restriction of $\sigma_{K_n}$ and $\sigma_K$ to $U$, then $u_n$ converges to $u$ weakly as $n \to \infty$ because $\sigma_{K_n}(\{a\}) = \sigma_{K}(\{a\})$ and $\sigma_{K_n}(\{x\}) = \sigma_{K}(\{x\})$. Define $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda$ as the restriction of $\sigma_{K_n}$ and $\sigma_K$ to $V$.

We will prove that $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ weakly as $n \to \infty$. Take any continuity set $X \subseteq S^1$ of $\lambda$ so that $\lambda(\partial X) = 0$. By the Portmanteau theorem on finite measures, it suffices to show $\lambda_n(X) \to \lambda(X)$. Because $\partial(X \cap V) \subseteq (\partial X \cap V) \cup \partial V$, and both $u(\partial X \cap V) = \lambda(\partial X)$ and $u(\partial V)$ are zero, the set $X \cap V$ is a continuity set of $u$. So $u_n(X \cap V) \to u(X \cap V)$ and thus $\lambda_n(X) \to \lambda(X)$ as $n \to \infty$. This completes the proof that $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ weakly as $n \to \infty$.

Now take the limit $n \to \infty$ to the [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] for polygons $K_n$:
$$
v_{K_n}^+(x) - v_{K_n}^+(a) = \int_{t \in (a, x]} v_t \, \sigma_{K_n}(dt).
$$
The left-hand side is equal to $v_K^+(x) - v_K^+(a)$ by $e_{K_n}(a) = e_{K}(a)$ and $e_{K_n}(x) = e_{K}(x)$. The right-hand side is equal to
$$
(v_{K_n}^+(x) - v_{K_n}^-(x)) + \int_{t \in S^1} v_t \, \lambda_n(dt)
$$
and by $e_{K_n}(x) = e_{K}(x)$ and the weak convergence $\lambda_n \to \lambda$, the expression converges to
$$
(v_{K}^+(x) - v_{K}^-(x)) + \int_{t \in S^1} v_t \, \lambda(dt) = \int_{t \in (a, x]} v_t\, \sigma_{K}(dt)
$$
thus completing the proof of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] for general convex body $K$. □
