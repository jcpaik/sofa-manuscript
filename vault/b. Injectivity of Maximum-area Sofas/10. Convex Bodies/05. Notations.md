# Convex Bodies

We will use all the notations defined in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/04. Notations/00. Preface]]. We quickly summarize important definitions and conventions. Refer to [[a. Angle Hypothesis/04. Notations/00. Preface]] for full details of the definition.

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a Borel measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively.

The set $S^1$ denotes $\mathbb{R}$ modulo $2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $\mu_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $\nu_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$.

A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. For any convex body $K$, its _support function_ $h_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value
$$
h_S(t) := \sup \left\{ s \cdot \mu_t : s \in S \right\}.
$$
The _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is the intersection $K \cap l_K(t)$.

The _one-dimensional Hausdorff measure_ $\mathcal{H}^1$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ measures the length of any line segments and curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The _surface area measure_ $\sigma_K$ of a convex body $K$ is defined, so that for any Borel subset $X$ of $S^1$, $\sigma_K(X)$ is equal to the total length $\mathcal{H}^1(Y)$ of the union $Y := \bigcup_{t \in X} e_K(t)$ of edges of $K$ with normal angles in $X$.
