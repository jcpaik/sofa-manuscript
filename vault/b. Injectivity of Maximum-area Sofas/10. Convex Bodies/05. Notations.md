# Convex Bodies

We will use all the notations defined in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/04. Notations/00. Preface]]. We quickly summarize important definitions and conventions. Refer to [[a. Angle Hypothesis/04. Notations/00. Preface]] for full details of the definition.

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a Borel measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively.

The set $S^1$ denotes $\mathbb{R}$ modulo $2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $\mu_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $\nu_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$.

A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. For any convex body $K$, its _support function_ $h_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value
$$
h_S(t) := \sup \left\{ s \cdot \mu_t : s \in S \right\}.
$$
The _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is the intersection $K \cap l_K(t)$.

The _one-dimensional Hausdorff measure_ $\mathcal{H}^1$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ measures the length of any line segments and curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The _surface area measure_ $\sigma_K$ of a convex body $K$ is defined, so that for any Borel subset $X$ of $S^1$, $\sigma_K(X)$ is equal to the total length $\mathcal{H}^1(Y)$ of the union $Y := \bigcup_{t \in X} e_K(t)$ of edges of $K$ with normal angles in $X$.

# Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure

Recall that a function $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is of _bounded variation_ if there is an absolute constant $C$ such that, for any partition $a = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = b$ of the closed interval $[a, b]$, the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \left| f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right|$ is bounded from above by $C$. 

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $df$ as the unique measure such that $df([a, t]) = f(t) - f(a)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes

The existence of such a measure $df$ is guaranteed by, say, restricting (p5, Theorem 4.3) of [@revuz2013continuous] to a finite closed interval. We will use $df$ in [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/05. Notations#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]] as the rigorous definition of the differential of the function $f(t)$ with respect to $t$.

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-linear].__ The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dF$ on domain $\mathbb{R}$, $[a, b]$, or $S^1$ is linear with respect to $F$.
> ^pro-lebesgue-stieltjes-linear

_Proof._ Let $F_1, F_2$ be arbitrary right-continuous functions of bounded variation, and $a, b$ be arbitrary real values. Observe that $d(aF_1 + bF_2)$ and $a \cdot dF_1 + b \cdot dF_2$ both agree on any half-open interval $I$, and use [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness]] to conclude that they are equal. □

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on the domain $X$ which is either $S^1$ or a closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that both $F$ and $G$ are of bounded variation. Assume that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$.
> ^pro-lebesgue-stieltjes-product

_Proof._ We first prove the case where $X$ is a closed interval $I$. By Proposition 4.5, Chapter 0 of [@revuzContinuousMartingalesBrownian1999], we have the integration by parts
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a).
$$
for any endpoints $a \leq b$ in $I$. Now use $F(x-) = F(x)$ and [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness]] to conclude $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$. For the case where the domain is $X = S^1$, use the same argument for $F \circ q$ and $G \circ q$ with domain $X = [0, 2\pi]$, and apply [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle]]. □
