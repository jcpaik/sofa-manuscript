Recall that the _Minkowski sum_ $K_1 + K_2$ of two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ is defined as
$$
K_1 + K_2 = \left\{ p_1 + p_2 : p_1 \in K_1, p_2 \in K_2 \right\}.
$$
For any convex body $K$, its _dilation_ $aK$ by constant $a \geq 0$ is defined as
$$
aK = \left\{ ap : p \in K \right\}.
$$

> __Definition [linear-in-convex-body].__ We say that an expression $m(K)$ determined by an arbitrary planar convex body $K$ is _linear_ in $K$ if the linearity $m(a K_1 + b K_2) = a m (K_1) + b m (K_2)$ holds for any convex body $K_1, K_2$ and $a, b \geq 0$. ^def-linear-in-convex-body

Many function values defined on $K$ are linear.
