We show the following theorem that relates the vertices $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ of a convex body $K$ to its surface area measure $\sigma_K$.

> __Theorem [boundary-measure].__ For every half-open interval $I := (a, b]$ in of $\mathbb{R}$, we have ^thm-boundary-measure
$$
\mathrm{d} v_K^{+}(t) = u_t \, \sigma_K
$$
> where $v_K^+(t) : I \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and $u_t : I \to \mathbb{R}$ are taken as right-continuous functions of $t \in I$, and both sides are 

Consequently, we have
$$
\int_{t \in I} p(t) \cdot d v_K^+(t) = \int_{t \in I} (p(t) \cdot u_t) \,\sigma(dt)
$$
for any bounded measurable function $p : I \to \mathbb{R}^2$.

_Proof._ It suffices to check that for any $x \in I$, the pairs of measures $\mathrm{d} v_K^{+}(t)$ and $u_t \, \sigma$ agree on the subset $(a, x]$ of $I$. That is, we only need to check ^eqn-boundary-to-check
$$
v_K^+(x) - v_K^+(a) = \int_{t \in (a, x]} u_t\,\sigma_K(dt)
$$

We first prove that [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] holds when $K$ is a polygon. In this case, the measure $\sigma_K$ is a discrete measure where each proper edge $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t$ corresponds to a point mass of $\sigma_K$ with length $e_K(t)$ concentrated at $t$. So the right-hand side of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] measures the sum of all vectors from vertex $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$ along the proper edges $e_K(t)$ with angles $t \in (a, x]$. Adding up, the telescopic sum gives $v_K^+(x) - v_K^+(a)$ as we desire.

Now we prove [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] for a general convex body $K$. As in the proof of Theorem 8.3.3, p466 of [[@schneider_2013]], we can take a series $K_1, K_2, \dots$ of polygons converging to $K$ in the Hausdorff distance $d^\textrm{H}$ such that $e_{K_n}(a) = e_{K}(a)$ and $e_{K_n}(x) = e_{K}(x)$ for all $n \geq 1$. By Theorem 4.2.1, page 212 of [[@schneider_2013]], the measures $\sigma_{K_n}$ converge to $\sigma_K$ weakly as $n \to \infty$.

For any measure $\sigma$ on $S^1$ and a Borel subset $A$ of $S^1$, define the _restriction_ $\sigma|_A$ of $\sigma$ to $A$ as the measure on $S^1$ defined as $\sigma|_A(X) = \sigma(A \cap X)$. Define $U$ as the open set $S^1 \setminus \left\{ t_1, t_2 \right\}$ of $S$, and $V$ as the open interval $(t_1, t_2)$ of $S^1$. Define $u_n$ and $u$ as the restriction of $\sigma_{K_n}$ and $\sigma_K$ to $U$, then $u_n$ converges to $u$ weakly as $n \to \infty$ because $\sigma_{K_n}(\{t_i\}) = \sigma_{K}(\{t_i\})$ for $i = 1, 2$. Define $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda$ as the restriction of $\sigma_{K_n}$ and $\sigma_K$ to $V$. We want to prove that $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ weakly as $n \to \infty$. Take any continuity set $X$ of $\lambda$ so that $\lambda(\partial X) = 0$ and thus $u(\partial X \cap V) = 0$. Because $\partial(X \cap V) \subseteq (\partial X \cap V) \cup \partial V$, and both $u(\partial X \cap V)$ and $u(\partial V)$ are zero, the set $X \cap V$ is a continuity set of $u$. So $u_n(X \cap V) \to u(X \cap V)$ and thus $\lambda_n(X) \to \lambda(X)$ as $n \to \infty$. This completes the proof that $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ weakly as $n \to \infty$.

We take the limit $n \to \infty$ to the [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^eqn-boundary-to-check]] for polygons $K_n$:
$$
v_{K_n}^+(x) - v_{K_n}^+(a) = \int_{t \in (a, x]} v_t \, \sigma_{K_n}(dt).
$$
The left-hand side is equal to $v_K^+(x) - v_K^+(a)$ by the way we took $K_n$. The right-hand side is equal to
$$
(v_{K_n}^+(t_2) - v_{K_n}^-(t_2)) + \int_{t \in S^1} v_t \, \lambda_n(dt)
$$
and by $v_{K_n}^{\pm}(t_i) = v_{K}^{\pm}(t_i)$ and the weak convergence $\lambda_n \to \lambda$, the expression converges to
$$
(v_{K}^+(t_2) - v_{K}^-(t_2)) + \int_{t \in S^1} v_t \, \lambda(dt) = \int_{t \in (t_1, t_2]} v_t\, \sigma_{K}(dt)
$$
thus completing the proof for general $K$. â–¡
