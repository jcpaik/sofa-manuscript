All measurable functions used in this work will be bounded and have some compact interval domain $I$ of $\mathbb{R}$. All measures $\mu$ used in this work will be finite signed Borel measures on some compact interval $I$ of $\mathbb{R}$. That is, $\mu(X)$ is real-valued and not $\pm \infty$ for any Borel subset $X$ of $I$. 

For any bounded measurable function $f$ and finite signed Borel measure $\mu$ on a compact interval $I$ of $\mathbb{R}$, denote the multiplication of $f$ and $\mu$ as $f \, \mu$, which is defined as $f \mu(X) = \int_{X} f \, d \mu$.

Recall the following standard definition.

> __Definition [bounded-variation].__ A function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on a closed interval $I := [a, b]$ is of _bounded variation_ if there is an absolute constant $C$ such that, for any partition $a = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = b$ of $I$, the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \left| f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right|$ is bounded from above by $C$. ^def-bounded-variation

We use the notation $\textrm{d} f$ to denote the _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ of $f$. Note that $\textrm{d} f$ is different from the differential $d f$ used in integration.

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on $I := [a, b]$ of bounded variation, define the _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $\mathrm{d} f$ of $f$ on $I$ as the unique finite signed Borel measure such that $\mathrm{d} f([a, t]) = f(t) - f(a)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes

The existence of such a measure $\mathrm{d} f$ in [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/05. Notations#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]] is guaranteed by restricting Theorem 4.3, page 5 of [@revuz2013continuous] to a finite closed interval.

We use the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\mathrm{d} f$ to state informal calculations involving differentials like $d(t^2) = 2t \, dt$ rigorously, like $\textrm{d}(t^2) = 2t \, \textrm{d}t$. Here, the letter $t$ is taken as the variable parametrizing the domain $I$, which can be any compact interval of $\mathbb{R}$. So the followings hold.

- The measure $\textrm{d}(t^2)$ is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure of the function $f(t) = t^2$. So in particular, the measure $\textrm{d}(t^2)$ on an interval $[0, x] \subseteq I$ is equal to $x^2$.
- The measure $\textrm{d} t$ is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure of the function $g(t) = t$. That is, $\textrm{d} t$ is the usual Lebesgue measure on $I$.

Unlike differentials, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure has a rigorous interpretation that also works for any right-continous function $f$ that may not be continuous.

There is a subtle notational difference between the differential $d f$ and the measure $\mathrm{d} f$ that we clarify here. Assume that a finite interval $I$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is the domain we parametrize by the variable $t \in I$. The differential $dt$ is then considered as an intuitive (but not rigorous) notation for the infinitesimal subinterval of $I$ containing $t$. The measure $\mathrm{d} f$, however, is a well-defined finite singed measure on $I$. Now:

1. Any measurable function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on $I$ takes the variable $t$ but not the differential $dt$.
2. Any measure $\mu$ on $I$ can be used to integrate $f$, taking the differential $dt$ (not the variable $t$) as the input in the integral notation $\int_{t \in I} f(t) \, \mu(dt)$.

Let us integrate a bounded measurable function $g : I \to \mathbb{R}$ with respect to the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\textrm{d} f$ of some $f$. Then the integral
$$
\int_{t\in X} g(t) \, \mathrm{d}f(dt) = \int_{t\in X} g(t) \, df(t) = \int_{X} g \, df
$$
is the _Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral_ of $g$ with respect to $f$. 

3. 

The operator '$\textrm{d}$' mapping $f$ to $\textrm{d} f$ is linear like differentials would do.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-sum].__ For any real values $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, finite closed interval $I$, and right-continuous $f, g : I \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, we have $\textrm{d} (a f + b g) = a \, \textrm{d} f + b \, \textrm{d} g$ as signed measures on $I$. ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-sum

The product rule $d(fg) = g \, df + f \, dg$ of differentials is more subtle as we allow $f$ and $g$ to be not continuous. We need to require one of $f$ or $g$ to be continuous.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ For any finite closed interval $I$, and right-continuous $f, g : I \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, if one of $f$ or $g$ is continuous then the equality $\mathrm{d}(fg) = g \, \mathrm{d}f + f \, \mathrm{d}g$ holds. ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-product

_Proof._ Assume without loss of generality that $f$ is continuous. Write $I = [a, b]$. It suffices to show that both sides, as measures on $I$, agree on the subset $\left\{ a \right\}$ and $(a, x]$ of $I$ for all $x \in I$. By [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]] with $t = a$, the values of both sides on the singleton $\left\{ a \right\}$ are equal to zero. Now take any $x \in I$. By Proposition 4.5, page 6 of [@revuzContinuousMartingalesBrownian1999], we have the integration by parts
$$
\int_{t \in (a, x]} g(t)\, df(t) + \int_{t \in (a, x]} f(t-) \, dg(t) = f(x) g(x) - f(a) g(a)
$$
where $f(t-)$ denotes the _left limit_ of $f$ at $t$ which is different from $f(t)$ in definition. However, as our $f$ is continuous their values $f(t-) = f(t)$ match. The equality  â–¡
