Recall that a function $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is of _bounded variation_ if there is an absolute constant $C$ such that, for any partition $a = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = b$ of the closed interval $[a, b]$, the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \left| f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right|$ is bounded from above by $C$.

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $\delta f$ as the unique Borel measure such that $\delta f([a, t]) = f(t) - f(a)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes

The existence of such a measure $\delta f$ in [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/05. Notations#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]] is guaranteed by, say, restricting Theorem 4.3, page 5 of [@revuz2013continuous] to a finite closed interval. That the linearity $\lambda_{af} = a \lambda_f$ and $\lambda_{f + g} = \lambda_f + \lambda_g$ for functions $f, g$ and scalar $a$ is immediate from [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/05. Notations#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]].

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on the domain $X$ which is either $S^1$ or a closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that both $F$ and $G$ are of bounded variation. Assume that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$.

_Proof._ We first prove the case where $X$ is a closed interval $I$. By Proposition 4.5, Chapter 0 of [@revuzContinuousMartingalesBrownian1999], we have the integration by parts
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a).
$$
for any endpoints $a \leq b$ in $I$. Now use $F(x-) = F(x)$ and [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness]] to conclude $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$. For the case where the domain is $X = S^1$, use the same argument for $F \circ q$ and $G \circ q$ with domain $X = [0, 2\pi]$, and apply [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle]]. â–¡
