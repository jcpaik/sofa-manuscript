Recall that a function $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is of _bounded variation_ if there is an absolute constant $C$ such that, for any partition $a = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = b$ of the closed interval $[a, b]$, the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \left| f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right|$ is bounded from above by $C$.

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $\mathrm{d} f$ on $[a, b]$ as the unique Borel measure such that $\mathrm{d} f([a, t]) = f(t) - f(a)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes

The existence of such a measure $\mathrm{d} f$ in [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/05. Notations#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]] is guaranteed by, say, restricting Theorem 4.3, page 5 of [@revuz2013continuous] to a finite closed interval.

We will use the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\mathrm{d} f$ as a rigorous replacement of the differential $df$. An interval $I$ is always parametrized by letter $t \in I$ unless specified otherwise.

- For a Borel-measurable function $f$ and a Borel measure $u$, write $f \, u$ for the measure $u$ multiplied with function $f$. To avoid confusion, 
- For any _pair_ of measures $u = (u_1, u_2)$, write the pair $(f\, u_1, f \, u_2)$ as simply $f \, u$.
- The integral $\int_{t\in X} g(t) \, \mathrm{d}f(dt)$ of $g$ on $X$ with respect to the measure $\mathrm{d} f$ is, by definition, equal to the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral $\int_{t \in X} g(t)\,df(t)$.
	- So as differentials, we have $\mathrm{d}f(dt) = df(t)$. Note the subtle change in $d$.
- We can write $\mathrm{d}(t^2) = 2t \, \mathrm{d} t$. 

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on the domain $X$ which is either $S^1$ or a closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that both $F$ and $G$ are of bounded variation. Assume that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $\mathrm{d}(FG) = G \, \mathrm{d}F + F \, \mathrm{d}G$.

_Proof._ We first prove the case where $X$ is a closed interval $I$. By Proposition 4.5, Chapter 0 of [@revuzContinuousMartingalesBrownian1999], we have the integration by parts
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a)
$$
for any endpoints $a \leq b$ in $I$. Now use $F(x-) = F(x)$ and [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness]] to conclude $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$. â–¡
