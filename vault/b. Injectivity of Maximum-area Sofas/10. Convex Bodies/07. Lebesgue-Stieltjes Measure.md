For any real-valued measurable function $f$ and Borel measure $\mu$ on a Borel subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, denote the multiplication of $f$ and $\mu$ as $f \, \mu$. That is, $f \, \mu$ is a 

Recall the following standard definition.

> __Definition [bounded-variation].__ A function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on a closed interval $I := [a, b]$ is of _bounded variation_ if there is an absolute constant $C$ such that, for any partition $a = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = b$ of $I$, the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \left| f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right|$ is bounded from above by $C$. ^def-bounded-variation

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $\mathrm{d} f$ on $[a, b]$ as the unique Radon measure such that $\mathrm{d} f([a, t]) = f(t) - f(a)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes

The existence of such a measure $\mathrm{d} f$ in [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Convex Bodies/05. Notations#^def-lebesgue-stieltjes]] is guaranteed by restricting Theorem 4.3, page 5 of [@revuz2013continuous] to a finite closed interval.

Using the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\mathrm{d} f$, we can justify informal equalities involving differentials like $d(t^2) = 2t \, dt$ rigorously as $\textrm{d}(t^2) = 2t \, \textrm{d}t$. Here, $t$ is taken as the variable parametrizing the domain $I := [0, 1]$ (or any finite interval of your choice). The expression $\textrm{d}(t^2)$ (resp. $\textrm{d} t$) is then the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure on the set $I$ of the function $f(t) = t^2$ (resp. $f(t) = t$). So:

- The measure $\textrm{d}(t^2)$ is a Borel measure which, on an interval $[0, x] \subseteq I$, has a value equal to $x^2$.
- The measure $\textrm{d} t$ is the usual Lebesgue measure on $I$.

Unlike differentials, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure has a clear interpretation and also works for any right-continous function $f$ that may not be continuous. With this advantage, we will use the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral $\mathrm{d} f$ to define and prove 

There is a subtle notational difference between the measure $\mathrm{d} f$ and the differential $d f$ that we clarify here. Assume that a finite interval $I$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is the domain we parametrize by the variable $t \in I$. Now:

1. Any measurable function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on $I$ can be assumed to take the variable $t$ (but not the differential $dt$).
2. Any measure $\mu$ on $I$ can be used to integrate $f$, taking the differential $dt$ (not the variable $t$) as the input in the integral notation $\int_{t \in I} f(t) \, \mu(dt)$.

If the measure $\mu$ is itself the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure of some $f$,  

3. 

- For a Borel-measurable function $f$ and a Borel measure $u$, write $f \, u$ for the measure $u$ multiplied with function $f$. To avoid confusion, 
- For any _pair_ of measures $\mu = (\mu_1, \mu_2)$, write the pair $(f\, u_1, f \, u_2)$ as simply $f \, u$.
- The integral $\int_{t\in X} g(t) \, \mathrm{d}f(dt)$ of $g$ on $X$ with respect to the measure $\mathrm{d} f$ is, by definition, equal to the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral $\int_{t \in X} g(t)\,df(t)$.
	- So as differentials, we have $\mathrm{d}f(dt) = df(t)$. Note the subtle change in $d$.
- We can write $\mathrm{d}(t^2) = 2t \, \mathrm{d} t$. 

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on the domain $X$ which is either $S^1$ or a closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that both $F$ and $G$ are of bounded variation. Assume that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $\mathrm{d}(FG) = G \, \mathrm{d}F + F \, \mathrm{d}G$.

_Proof._ We first prove the case where $X$ is a closed interval $I$. By Proposition 4.5, Chapter 0 of [@revuzContinuousMartingalesBrownian1999], we have the integration by parts
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a)
$$
for any endpoints $a \leq b$ in $I$. Now use $F(x-) = F(x)$ and [[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness]] to conclude $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$. â–¡
