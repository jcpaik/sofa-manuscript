We will often write equalities of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures in the form of differentials. The variable $t \in I$ will always parametrize $I$ and will be the input of every functions. For any measure $\lambda$, $\lambda(dt)$ denotes the $\lambda$ on the 'differential' $\lambda$. For any Borel function $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$, the measure $f \lambda$ in the form of differentials will be $f(t) \lambda(dt)$. We will denote the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\lambda_f$ of $f$ as $d f(t)$.
