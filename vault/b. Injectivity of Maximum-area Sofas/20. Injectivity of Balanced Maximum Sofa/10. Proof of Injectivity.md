Here, we prove the one-sided balancedness inequality () that will be used in establishing the injectivity condition of a maximum-area sofa.

We use the result established in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] that a _balanced maximum sofa_ $S_{\infty}$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ exists. Such a sofa $S_{\infty}$ is defined as a monotone sofa with a _balanced maximum cap_ $K_{\infty}$, which is the limit of _balanced polygon caps_ $K_1, K_2, \dots$ converging to $K$ in Hausdorff distance $d_\text{H}$. Each balanced polygon cap $K_i$ have angle set $\Theta_{n_i}$ with $n_i$ increasing powers of 2. We refer the reader to review [[a. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] for the precise statements. To refer to each polygon cap $K_i$ more easily, we introduce the following notion.

> __Definition [simple-notation-balanced-cap].__ Say that $K \in \mathcal{K}$ is a _balanced polygon cap_ with $n$ _steps_ of _step size_ $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$, if $n > 1$ and $n$ is a power of two, and $K$ is a balanced polygon cap with the angle set $\Theta_n := \left\{ (\pi/2) i / n : 1 \leq i < n \right\}$. ^def-simple-notation-balanced-cap

To prove the one-sided balancedness inequality () which is our goal here, we first establish a discrete version of the inequality for any balanced polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps of step size $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$. Then we will take the limit $n \to \infty$ (and accordingly $\delta \to 0$), so that the polygon cap $K$ converges to the balanced maximum cap $K_{\infty}$ satisfying the promised inequality. We use the following [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-o-notation]] to control error terms bounded by absolute functions of $\delta$.

> __Definition [o-notation].__ We write $f(\delta) = O_\delta(g(\delta))$ if the value of $g(\delta)$ depends solely on $\delta$ and not other values, and there are absolute constants $C, \epsilon > 0$ such that for every $|\delta| < \epsilon$, we have $|f(\delta)| \leq C g(\delta)$. ^def-o-notation

Note that in [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-o-notation]], the value $f(\delta)$ might depend on other values than $\delta$ (like an arbitrary cap $K$), but the value of $g(\delta)$ should depend solely on $\delta$. For example, we can write $\delta^2 / (1 + p_K(0)^2) = O_\delta(\delta^2)$ where $K \in \mathcal{K}$ can be arbitrary, but we cannot write $\delta^2 = O_\delta(\delta^2(1+p_K(0)^2))$ as the value inside $O_\delta$ is not determined by $\delta$ only.

> __Lemma [leg-bounded].__ Any maximum polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps have the diameter at most $5$. Consequently, the functions $f_K^{\pm}$ and $g_K^{\pm}$ are bounded from above by 5. ^lem-leg-bounded

_Proof._ Since $n > 1$ is a power of two by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-simple-notation-balanced-cap]], the angle set $\Theta_n$ of $K$ contains the angle $\pi/4$. By [[a. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-cap-connected]], the cap $K$ satisfies the condition (1) of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Cap Contains Niche#^thm-monotonization-connected-iff]]. So the cap $K$ also satisfies the condition (3) of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Cap Contains Niche#^thm-monotonization-connected-iff]], and the point $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/4)$ is either in $K$ or have $y$-coordinate less than zero. Either way, the $y$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/4)$ is at most one. Now $K \subseteq H \cap Q_K^+(\pi/4)$ and the polygon $H \cap Q_K^+(\pi/4)$ have diameter at most $2 + 2\sqrt{2} < 5$. So $K$ have diameter at most 5.

For any $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, the points $A_K^{\pm}(t), C_K^{\pm}(t)$ are in $K$, so the distance between those points are also bounded from above by 5. Now by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/05. Arm Lengths#^def-cap-tangent-arm-length]] the values $f_K^{\pm}(t), g_K^{\pm}(t)$ are bounded from above by the distances between points $A_K^{\pm}(t), C_K^{\pm}(t)$, and subsequently by 5. □

> __Lemma [arm-length-discrete-bound].__ Let $K$ be any maximum polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps with step size $\delta := (\pi/2) / n$ and angle set $\Theta := \Theta_n$. For any angle $t \in \Theta$ and open interval $I := (t - \delta, t)$, the following holds. ^lem-arm-length-discrete-bound
> 
> 1. For any $t' \in I$, we have $f_K^+(t - \delta) \leq f_K^{+}(t') = f_K^-(t') \leq f_K^-(t)$.
> 2. Moreover, the gap $f_K^-(t) - f_K^+(t - \delta)$ between lower and upper bound is at most $5 \delta$.

_Proof._ Since the angles $t - \delta$ and $t$ are two adjacent angles of the finite set $\Theta \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$, we have
$$
A_K^+(t - \delta) = A_K^-(t) = A_K^+(t') = A_K^-(t')
$$
for all $t' \in I$. Call the common point $A$. Similarly, we have
$$
C_K^+(t - \delta) = C_K^-(t) = C_K^{+}(t') = C_K^{-}(t')
$$
for all $t' \in I$. Call the common point $C$. Now for all $t' \in \overline{I} = [t - \delta, t]$, the lines $a_K(t')$ and $c_K(t')$ meet orthogonally at the point $\mathbf{y}_K(t')$, the line $a_K(t')$ passes through $A$, and the line $c_K(t')$ passes through $C$ respectively. So by elementary geometry, the points $\mathbf{y}_K(t')$ for all $t' \in \overline{I}$ are on the circle $\Gamma$ with the line segment connecting $A$ and $C$ as diameter. The points $\mathbf{y}_K(t')$ for all $t' \in \overline{I}$ form an arc with central angle $2\delta$. So the distance between $\mathbf{y}_K(t - \delta)$ and $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$ is bounded from above by $5 \delta$. $f_K^+(t - \delta)$ is the distance from $A$ to $\mathbf{y}_K(t - \delta)$, and $f_K^-(t)$ is the distance from $A$ to $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$.

> 2. $\mathcal{H}^1(d_K(t) \cap g_K^b(t - \delta)) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, 1 - f_K^-(t) + \tan(\delta / 2))$

_Proof._ (1) See the left side of [[old/xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^fig-leg-computation]]. This is a picture of $L_K(t)$ in perspective of upright position. Let $z$ be the intersection of $\overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{d}_K(t)$. Let $\alpha$ be the real value such that $z + \alpha u_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. Then we have $\mathcal{H}^1(d_K(t) \cap g_K^r(t + \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$. It remains to show that $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot (f_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta / 2) - 1)$. Let $w_a$ be the intersection of $a_K(t + \delta)$ and $a_K(t)$. Let $w_b$ be the intersection of $\overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{b}_K(t)$. Since the pairs of lines are parallel of distance 1, we have $(w_a - w_b) \cdot v_t = \tan(\delta/2)$. Let $\beta := (\mathbf{x}_K(t) - w_b) \cdot v_t$. By computation before we have $\beta = f_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta / 2) - 1$. Ratio between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot \beta$. □

Note that $m$ is monotonically increasing. It's a piecewise function that satisfies $m(0) = -1$, $m(1) = 1/2$, $m(x) = 1$ for $x \geq 2$.

With the lemmas above, we bound one side length of a maximum polygon cap.

> __Lemma [balanced-discrete-ineq].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ be any maximum polygon cap with uniform angle set $\Theta := \Theta_{\pi/2, n}$ of size $n-1$ and interval length $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$. Take any $t \in \Theta$. We have the following bound. ^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq
$$
\sigma_K(t + \pi/2) \leq k(f_K^-(t)) \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$

_Proof._ Write $s := \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$. Let $X := d_K(t) \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ be the side(s) of $\mathcal{N}_K$ contributed by the half-line $d_K(t)$ form $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. The main idea is to bound the length $\mathcal{H}^1(X)$ of $X$ from above, and then use balancedness of $K$. Let $U := \left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\}$ and  $R := \bigcup_{u \in U} g_K^b (u)$ be the union of three half-planes. Divide $X$ into $X \cap R$ and $X \setminus R$. We bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ and $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ separately.

We first bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ from above. As $X \subseteq d_K(t)$, we have
$$
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) \leq \mathcal{H}^1(d_K(t) \cap R) = \max(d_K(t) \cap g_K^r(t - \delta), d_K(t) \cap g_K^r(t + \delta))
$$
By the computation in [[old/xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^lem-leg-computation]], we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) & \leq \delta \max(0, f_K^+(t) - 1, 1 - f_K^-(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2) \\
& \leq \delta |f_K^-(t) - 1| + O_\delta(\delta^2)
\end{align*}
$$

Now we bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ from above. Define $Y := R \cup H_-(\pi/2, 0)$. Then $Y$ is disjoint from $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ and the boundary of $Y$ intersects $\overline{d}_K(t)$ at only a finite number of points. Since $X \subseteq \overline{d}_K(t)$, we have
$$
X \setminus R \subseteq d_K(t) \cap \partial (\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup Y).
$$
The set $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup Y$ now contains $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \bigcap_{t \in U} g_K^d(t)$. Define $D_+ = \overline{d}_K(t) \cap \overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $D_- = \overline{d}_K(t) \cap \overline{d}_K(t - \delta)$ as the intersections of infinite extensions of $d_K(t)$ and $d_K(t \pm \delta)$. $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ is bounded by the line segment connecting $D_+$ and $D_-$. So
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R) & \leq \max(0, 2 \tan (\delta / 2) - \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)) \\
& = \max(0, \delta - s) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
\end{align*}
$$

Now
$$
s \leq \mathcal{H}^1(X) \leq \int_{t - \delta}^{t} |f_K^-(u) - 1| \, du + \max(0, \delta - s) + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$

If $s \leq \delta$, then we have
$$
s \leq \int_{t - \delta}^{t} \frac{|f_K^-(u) - 1| + 1}{2} \, du + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$
and if $s > \delta$, then
$$
s \leq \int_{t - \delta}^{t} |f_K^-(u) - 1| \, du + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$
so either way we have $s \leq \int_{t - \delta}^{t} k(f_K^-(u)) \, du + O_\delta(\delta^2)$. □

> __Lemma [leg-convergence].__ Assume $K_n \to K$ in Hausdorff distance. Then $g_{K_n}^+ \to f_K^+$ in distribution. ^lem-leg-convergence

_Proof._ $f_K$ is convolution with $\sigma_K$. □

We now take the limit of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]] to show a corresponding inequality in 

> __Lemma [balanced-ineq-limit].__ Let $K_{\infty}$ be a balanced maximum cap, so that it is the limit of balanced polygon caps $K_1, K_2, \dots$ with number of steps $n_1 < n_2 < \dots$ and step sizes $\delta_1 > \delta_2 > \dots$. Then the measure $\sigma_K(dt + \pi/2)$ on $t \in (0, \pi/2]$ is supressed by the measure with distribution $k(f_K^-(t))$ and $t \in [0, \pi/2]$. ^lem-balanced-ineq-limit

_Proof._ Fix an index $i \geq 1$. For any $t \in \Theta_{n_i}$, we have ^single-step-integral
$$
\sigma_{K_i}\left( (t, t + \delta_i] \right) \leq \delta_i \cdot k(f_{K_i}^-(t)) =  \int_t^{t + \delta_n} k(f_{K_i}^-(u)) \, du + O_{\delta_i}(\delta_i^2)
$$
by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^lem-arm-length-discrete-bound]].

Now for any $a, b \in \Theta_{n_i} \cup \left\{ \pi/2 \right\}$ and the interval $I = (a, b]$ the inequality ^polygon-integral
$$
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{K_n}(I) & = \sum_{t \in [a, b) \cap \Theta_{n_i}} \sigma_{K_i}\left( (t, t+ \delta_i] \right) \\
& \leq \left( \sum_{t \in [a, b) \cap \Theta_{n_i}} \int_t^{t + \delta_n} k(f_{K_i}^-(u)) \, du \right)  + O_\delta(\delta) \\
& = \int_a^b k(f_{K_i}^-(u))\,du + O_{\delta_i}(\delta_i)
\end{align*}
$$
holds by summing up [[#^single-step-integral]] for all $t \in I \cap \Theta_{n_i}$ and using that $|I \cap \Theta_{n_i}| = O_{\delta_i}(1/\delta_i)$.

Let $\Theta$ be the set of dyadic angles in $(0, \pi/2)$ so that $\Theta = \bigcup_i \Theta_{n_i}$. Take arbitrary $a, b \in \Theta$. Then for any sufficiently large $i \geq 1$, we have $a, b \in \Theta_{n_i}$ so [[#^polygon-integral]] holds. So we can take $i \to \infty$ in [[#^polygon-integral]] and by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^lem-leg-convergence]] we get
$$
\sigma_K(I) =

TODO: Taking half-open $I$, we can't bound $\sigma_K(I)$ with $\sigma_{K_i}(I)$.

> __Theorem [leg-length-bounds].__ $g^{\pm}, h^{\pm}$ signs don't matter and are absolutely continuous. Also $h'_K(t) + f_K(t) \leq k(f_K(t))$ almost everywhere. That is, $- g'_K(t) \geq m(f_K(t))$ almost everywhere. By symmetry, we also have $f_K'(t) \geq m(g_K(t))$. ^thm-leg-length-bounds

TODO: This is the step where we have to relate arm lengths $f, g$ and the surface area measure $\sigma$. 

By mirror symmetry, any lower bound $f_n(t)$ of $f_K(t)$ gives a lower bound $f_{n}(\pi/2-t)$ of $g_K(t)$. [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^thm-leg-length-bounds]] then transfers any lower bound of $g_K(t)$ to a lower bound of $f_K'(t)$. Integrating $f_K'(t)$ and its lower bound $m(f_{n}(\pi/2-t))$, we obtain a new lower bound $f_{n+1}(t)$ of $f_K(t)$. Let us now iterate this indefinitely to get a good lower bound of $f_K$ ([[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^lem-lower-bound-sequence]]).

> __Lemma [lower-bound-sequence].__ The following holds for any $n \geq 0$. Let $K \in \mathcal{K}$ be any balanced maximum cap. Then we have $f_K(t) \geq f_n(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$ and $g_K(t) \geq f_n(\pi/2 - t)$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. ^lem-lower-bound-sequence

_Proof._ Induct on $n$. The base case $n \geq 0$ holds trivially. Now assume the inductive hypothesis that for any balanced maximum cap $K'$, we have $f_{K'}(t) \geq f_n(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$ and $g_{K'}(t) \geq f_n(\pi/2 - t)$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. Fix any balanced maximum cap $K$. For any $t \in [0, \pi/2)$, we have
$$
f_K(t) = f_K(0) + \int_0^t f_K'(u) \,du \geq f_K(0) + \int_0^t m(g_K(u)) \,du \geq f_K(0) + \int_0^t m(f_K(\pi/2 - u)) \,du 
$$
by the inductive hypothesis on $K' := K$ and [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^thm-leg-length-bounds]]. This combined with the inductive hypothesis $f_{K}(t) \geq f_n(t)$ on $K' := K$ implies that $f_K(t) \geq f_{n+1}(t)$.

From the inductive hypothesis, we proved $f_K(t) \geq f_{n+1}(t)$ for any balanced maximum cap $K$ and $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. Applying the same argument to $K' := K^{\mathrm{op}}$, we also have $f_{K^\mathrm{\textrm{op}}}(t) \geq f_{n+1}(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. This by XX is equivalent to the other inequality $g_K(t) \geq f_{n+1}(\pi/2 - t)$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. □

> __Lemma [lower-bound-limit].__ Define $f_{\infty} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ as the pointwise limit $f_\infty(x) = \lim_{ _{n \to \infty} } f_n(x)$. Then $f_{\infty}$ is well-defined, bounded, continuous, and satisfies $f_{\infty}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{\infty}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. ^lem-lower-bound-limit

_Proof._ By [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-lower-bound-sequence]], for any $x \in [0, \pi/2]$ the sequence $f_n(x)$ with index $n$ is monotonically increasing. As the function $m$ is bounded from above by $1$, by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-lower-bound-sequence]] we have the global upper bound $f_n(x) \leq 1 + x$ for any $x \in [0, \pi/2]$ and $n \geq 0$. So the function $f_{\infty} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ is well-defined. By Dini's theorem, 

We now show that for any $n \geq 1$ and $x \in (0, \pi/2]$, we have the strict inequality $f_{n+1}(x) > f_n(x)$. The base case $n = 1$ have to be checked manually. By calculation, we have $f_1(x) = 1 -x$ for all $x \leq 1$ and $f_1(x) = 0$ for all $x > 1$. Also by calculation, we have

- $f_2(x) = 1 - x$ for all $x \leq \pi/2 - 1$,
- $f_2(x) = 2 - \pi/2 + \int_{\pi/2 - 1}^x \left( 3/2 () -1 \right) \,du$ for all $\pi/2 - 1 \leq x \leq 1$,
- $f_2(x) = $ for all $x \geq 1$.

Now assume the inductive hypothesis that $f_{n+1}(x) > f_n(x)$ for all $x \in (0, \pi/2]$. By [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-lower-bound-sequence]] we have $f_{n+1}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. Since $f_n$'s are globally bounded by 2, and the function $m$ is strictly increasing on the domain $[0, 2]$, we have
$$
1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n+1}(\pi/2 - u))\, du > 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n}(\pi/2 - u))\, du = f_{n+1}(x)
$$
for all $x > 0$ by the inductive hypothesis. So the left-hand side is equal to $f_{n+2}(x)$ by [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^def-lower-bound-sequence]], and we prove $f_{n+2}(x) > f_{n+1}(x)$ as desired.

Since $f_{n+1}(x) > f_n(x)$ for all $x \in (0, \pi/2]$, we have $f_{n+1}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. Now take $n \to \infty$ and obtain $f_{\infty}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{\infty}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. □

We now move on to computing $f_{\infty}$ explicitly. We rely on `Mathematica` to check the following calculation; this could be checked rigorously using interval arithmetic if desired.

_Proof._ We first show that there is a unique differentiable function $f : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(x) = m(f(\pi/2-x))$. Let $e(x) = f(\pi/2 - x)$. Then we have a set of ODEs

i. $f'(x) = m(e(x))$ and
ii. $e'(x) = - f'(\pi/2 - u) = - m(e(\pi/2-x)) = - m(f(x))$

with conditions $f(0) = 1$ and $e(\pi/2) = 1$. As $m$ is bounded by 1, for any initial condition $(e(0), f(0)) = (C, 1)$ with $C \in \mathbb{R}$ we have a unique global solution $e, f : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (i) and (ii).

Now it suffices to check that the suggested function $f = f_{\infty}$ satisfies the equality $f'(x) = m(f(\pi/2-x))$. Check the followings in order.

1. The values of $f(t)$ on $t \in [0, T_0]$ range from $1$ to $1 + T_0$.
2. By (1) and (2) of [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Proof of Injectivity#^pro-lower-bound-constants]], the values of $f(t)$ on $t \in [T_0, \pi/2 - T_0]$ range from $1+T_0$ to 2.
3. By the definition of $f$, the values of $f(t)$ on $t \in [\pi/2 - T_0, \pi/2]$ is at least 2.

So we have $m(f(t)) = sss$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2 - T_0]$ and $m(f(t)) = 1$ on $t \in [\pi/2 - T_0, \pi/2]$. Checking $f'(x) = m(f(\pi/2-x))$ is now calculation that we omit. □
