We prove the $x$-monotonicity of a maximum-area moving sofa. This is an important property that will be used to prove the optimality of Gerver's sofa in a subsequent work.

The purpose of this [[b. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/00. Preface]] is to show the following x-monotoneness of a maximum-area sofa.

> __Theorem [x-monotone].__ There exists a cap $K$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ such that the followings are true. ^thm-x-monotone
> 
> 1. $K$ attains the maximum of the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}_{\pi/2}$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K$ is continuously differentiable, and for every $t \in (0, \pi/2)$ we have $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot u_0 < 0$.
