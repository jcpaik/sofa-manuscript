Fix an arbitrary planar convex body $K$, which by [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-convex-body]] is a nonempty, compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This appendix defines and proves numerous properties of $K$. For the ease of understanding it is recommended to access the parts this appendix . However, an interested reader can read this appendix from beginning to end to verify the correctness of all proofs and theorems.

We will allow the case where $K$ have empty interior in most theorems, and we will make the condition explicit in a theorem if $K$ is required to have nonempty interior.
