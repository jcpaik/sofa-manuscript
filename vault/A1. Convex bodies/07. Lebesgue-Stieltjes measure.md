For any right-continuous, real-valued function $F$ of bounded variation on domain $X = \mathbb{R}$ or $S^1 = \mathbb{R} / 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$, we will rigorously define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $dF$ on $X$. The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dF$ on any half-open interval $(a, b]$ calculates the difference $F(b) - F(a)$ of $F$ along the boundary.

Most literature constructs $dF$ for any right-continuous and monotonically increasing $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ (Theorem 3.5. of Stein) For any right-continuous and monotonically increasing function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.

Now let $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be any right-continuous function of bounded variation, which is not necessarily increasing. We can still define $dF$ by allowing $dF$ to be a _signed_ measure.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed].__ For any right-continuous and  function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique signed measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed

_Proof._ Write $F$ as the difference of two right-continuous, monotonically increasing, and bounded functions $F_1, F_2 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Then the measures $dF_1$ and $dF_2$ are well-defined from [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes]]. So the bounded signed measure $dF := dF_1 - dF_2$ is well-defined and satisfies $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$. For the uniqueness of $dF$, assume two candidates $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ of $dF$ so that $\mu_i((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for $i=1,2$ and any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$. Now the difference $\lambda = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ is a signed measure which is zero on any half-open interval. Appeal to the Jordan decomposition theorem to write $\lambda$ as the difference $\lambda^+ - \lambda^-$ of two non-negative measures. Then $\lambda^+$ and $\lambda^-$ match in their value on any half-open interval. Now use the Caratheodory extension theorem to show $\lambda^+ = \lambda^-$ and that $\lambda = 0$, so $\mu_1 = \mu_2$. □

We can restrict the domain of $F$ to a bounded closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval].__ For any right-continuous function $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ on $[a, b]$ such that $dF(a) = 0$ and for any half-open interval $(c, d] \subseteq [a, b]$, $dF\left( (c, d] \right) = F(d) - F(c)$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval

_Proof._ Define the extension $F_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $F$ as $F_0(x) = F(a)$ for all $x < a$, $F_0(x) = F(b)$ for all $x > b$, and observe that $F_0$ is also right-continuous and of bounded variation. So the measure $dF_0$ exists by [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed]]. Observe that $dF_0(a) = 0$ because 
$$
dF_0(a) = \lim_{ \epsilon \to 0 } dF_0((a - \epsilon, a]) = \lim_{ \epsilon \to 0 } F_0(a) - F_0(a - \epsilon) = 0.
$$
Now restrict the measure $dF_0$ on $\mathbb{R}$ to $[a, b]$ to construct $dF$.

For the uniqueness of such $dF$, take the difference $\lambda = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ of any two candidates $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ of $dF$, and appeal to the  □

We now allow the domain of $F$ to be $S^1$. Recall the convention that the interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ also denotes the corresponding interval of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$. Define $q : [0, 2\pi] \to S^1$ as the quotient map $q(t) = t + 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ identifying $0$ and $2\pi$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-circle].__ For any right-continuous function $F : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique bounded signed measure $dF$ on $S^1$ such that for any half-open interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $t_1 < t_2 \leq t_1 + 2\pi$, we have $dF((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)$. Moreover, such a $dF$ is unique, and is the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under $q$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle

_Proof._ The function $F \circ q : [0, 2\pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ is right-continuous and of bounded variation. So its Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d(F \circ q)$ on $[0, 2\pi]$ is well-defined by [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval]]. Now let $\mu$ be the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under the map $q$. Take any interval $I = (t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $0 \leq t_1 < t_2 \leq 2\pi$. we have
$$
\mu(I) = d(F \circ q)(q^{-1}(I)) = d(F \circ q)((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_1) - F(t_2)
$$
because $q^{-1}(I)$ is either $(t_1, t_2]$ (if $t_2 < 2\pi$) or $\left\{ 0 \right\} \cup (t_1, t_2]$ (if $t_2 = 2\pi$), and $d(F \circ q)(0) = 0$ by definition ([[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval]]).

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on the domain $X$ which is either $S^1$ or a closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that both $F$ and $G$ are of bounded variation. Assume that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$.
> ^pro-lebesgue-stieltjes-product

_Proof._ Let $F$ and $G$ be monotonically increasing and right-continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$. Theorem 21.67(iv) of [[@hewittRealAbstractAnalysis2013]] states that
$$
\int_{[a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{[a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a-) G(a-)
$$
holds for any $a \leq b$. Now use that $dF(\{a\}) = F(a) - F(a-)$ and $dG(\left\{ a \right\}) = G(a) - G(a-)$ to calculate
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a).
