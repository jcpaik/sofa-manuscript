For any right-continuous, real-valued function $F$ of bounded variation on domain $X = \mathbb{R}$ or $S^1 = \mathbb{R} / 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$, we will rigorously define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $dF$ on $X$. The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dF$ on any half-open interval $(a, b]$ calculates the difference $F(b) - F(a)$ of $F$ along the boundary.

Most literature constructs $dF$ for any right-continuous and monotonically increasing $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ [@steinRealAnalysisMeasure2005; @hewittRealAbstractAnalysis2013; @halmos2013measure].

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ (Theorem 3.5. of [@steinRealAnalysisMeasure2005]) For any right-continuous and monotonically increasing function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.

Now let $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be any right-continuous function of bounded variation, not necessarily increasing. We can still define $dF$ by allowing $dF$ to be a _signed_ measure. See p288 of [@steinRealAnalysisMeasure2005] for the notion of signed measure.

> ^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness

_Proof._ We first consider the case where $\mu_1, \mu_2$ are measures (not signed).  □

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed].__ For any right-continuous function $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique signed measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF(\left\{ a \right\}) = 0$ and $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open subinterval $(c, d]$ of $[a, b]$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed

_Proof._ Write $F$ as the difference $F = F_1 - F_2$ of two monotonically increasing and bounded functions $F_1, F_2 : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ (Theorem 3.3, p119 of [@steinRealAnalysisMeasure2005]). Take the right limit on $F(x) = F_1(x) - F_2(x)$ to further assume that $F_1, F_2$ are right-continuous. Extend the domain of $F_i$ for $i=1, 2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ by letting $F_i(x) = F_i(a)$ for $x < a$ and $F_i(x) = F_i(b)$ for $x > b$. The measures $dF_1$ and $dF_2$ on $\mathbb{R}$ are well-defined by [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes]] and bounded on $[a, b]$. So the bounded signed measure $dF := dF_1 - dF_2$ is well-defined and satisfies $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$. Appeal to [[A1. Convex bodies/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^lem-measure-interval-uniqueness]] for the uniqueness of such $dF$. □

We now allow the domain of $F : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ to be $S^1$. Define $q : [0, 2\pi] \to S^1$ as the quotient map $q(t) = t + 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ identifying the endpoints $0$ and $2\pi$. We will say that $F$ is _of bounded variation_ if and only if $F \circ q : [0, 2\pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ is of bounded variation. It is natural to define $dF$ using $d(F \circ q)$ where $F \circ q$ is defined on $[0, 2\pi]$. Recall the convention that the interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is used to denote the corresponding interval of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$. The only nontrivial portion of justifying the notion $d F$ is verifying that $dF$ measured on an interval $(t_1, t_2]$ with $0 <t_1 < 2\pi < t_2 < 4\pi$ wrapping around a circle.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-circle].__ For any right-continuous function $F : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique bounded signed measure $dF$ on $S^1$ such that for any half-open interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $t_1 < t_2 \leq t_1 + 2\pi$, we have $dF((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)$. Moreover, such $dF$ is unique, and is the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under the quotient map $q : [0, 2\pi] \to S^1$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle

_Proof._ The function $F \circ q : [0, 2\pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ is right-continuous and of bounded variation. So its Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d(F \circ q)$ on $[0, 2\pi]$ is well-defined by [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval]]. Now let $\mu$ be the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under the map $q$. Take any interval $I = (t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $0 \leq t_1 < t_2 \leq 2\pi$. We have
$$
\mu(I) = d(F \circ q)(q^{-1}(I)) = d(F \circ q)((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_1) - F(t_2)
$$
because $q^{-1}(I)$ is either $(t_1, t_2]$ (if $t_2 < 2\pi$) or $\left\{ 0 \right\} \cup (t_1, t_2]$ (if $t_2 = 2\pi$), and $d(F \circ q)(0) = 0$ by definition ([[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval]]). Now it suffices to show $\mu((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)$ for the case $0 \leq t_1 \leq 2\pi \leq t_2 \leq 4\pi$. We have
$$
\mu((t_1, t_2]) = \mu((t_1, 2\pi]) + \mu((2\pi, t_2]) = F(2\pi) - F(t_1) + F(t_2) - F(2\pi) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)
$$
thus completing the proof. □

_Proof._ Now the uniqueness of $dF$ in [[A1. Convex bodies/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle]]. □

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on the domain $X$ which is either $S^1$ or a closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Assume that both $F$ and $G$ are of bounded variation. Assume that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$.
> ^pro-lebesgue-stieltjes-product

_Proof._ Let $F$ and $G$ be monotonically increasing and right-continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$. Theorem 21.67(iv) of [@hewittRealAbstractAnalysis2013] states that
$$
\int_{[a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{[a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a-) G(a-)
$$
holds for any $a \leq b$. Now use that $dF(\{a\}) = F(a) - F(a-)$ and $dG(\left\{ a \right\}) = G(a) - G(a-)$ to calculate
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) = \int_{[a, b]} G(x)\,dF(x) - G(a) \left( F(a) - F(a-) \right)
$$
and
$$
\int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = \int_{[a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) - F(a-) \left( G(a) - G(a-) \right) 
$$
so
$$
\int_{(a, b]} G(x)\, dF(x) + \int_{(a, b]} F(x-) \, dG(x) = F(b) G(b) - F(a) G(a).
$$

Now use [[A1. Convex bodies/07. Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-uniqueness]] to conclude the differential
