For any right-continuous, real-valued function $F$ of bounded variation on domain $X = \mathbb{R}$ or $S^1 = \mathbb{R} / 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$, we will rigorously define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $dF$ on $X$. The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dF$ on any half-open interval $(a, b]$ calculates the difference $F(b) - F(a)$ of $F$ along the boundary.

Most literature defines $dF$ for any right-continuous and monotonically increasing $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ (Theorem 3.5. of Stein) For any right-continuous and monotonically increasing function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.

Now let $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be any right-continuous function of bounded variation, which is not necessarily increasing. We can still define $dF$ by allowing $dF$ to be a _signed_ measure.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed].__ For any right-continuous and  function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique signed measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed

_Proof._ Write $F$ as the difference of two right-continuous, monotonically increasing, and bounded functions $F_1, F_2 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Then the measures $dF_1$ and $dF_2$ are well-defined from [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes]]. So the bounded signed measure $dF := dF_1 - dF_2$ is well-defined and satisfies $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$. For the uniqueness of $dF$, assume two candidates $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ of $dF$ so that $\mu_i((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for $i=1,2$ and any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$. Now the difference $\lambda = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ is a signed measure which is zero on any half-open interval. Appeal to the Jordan decomposition theorem to write $\lambda$ as the difference $\lambda^+ - \lambda^-$ of two non-negative measures. Then $\lambda^+$ and $\lambda^-$ match in their value on any half-open interval. Now use the Caratheodory extension theorem to show $\lambda^+ = \lambda^-$ and that $\lambda = 0$, so $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ □

We can restrict the domain of $F$ to a bounded closed interval of $\mathbb{R}$. Also, we by allowing the measure $dF$ to be signed.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval].__ For any right-continuous function $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ such that $dF(a) = 0$ and for any half-open interval $(c, d] \subseteq [a, b]$, $dF\left( (c, d] \right) = F(d) - F(c)$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval

_Proof._ Define the extension $F_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $F$ as $F_0(x) = F(a)$ for all $x < a$, $F_0(x) = F(b)$ for all $x > b$, and observe that $F_0$ is also right-continuous and bounded variation. Restrict the measure $dF_0$ on $\mathbb{R}$ to $[a, b]$ to construct $dF$. For the uniqueness of such $dF$, note that for any two candidates $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ of $dF$, the difference measure $\lambda = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ is zero for all half-open intervals $(c, d]$. Use Haan decomposition to represent $\lambda$ with positive and negative part. The positive and negative part all match on half-open intervals. So $\lambda$ is zero by Caratheodory extension. □

We now allow the domain of $F$ to be $S^1$. Recall the convention that the interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ also denotes the corresponding interval of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$. Define $q : [0, 2\pi] \to S^1$ as the quotient map $q(t) = t + 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ identifying $0$ and $2\pi$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-circle].__ For any right-continuous function $F : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ on $S^1$ such that for any half-open interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $t_1 < t_2 \leq t_1 + 2\pi$, we have $dF((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)$. Moreover, such $dF$ is unique, and is the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under $q$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle

_Proof._ The function $F \circ q : [0, 2\pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ is right-continuous and of bounded variation. So its Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d(F \circ q)$ on $[0, 2\pi]$ is well-defined by [[#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval]]. Now let $\mu$ be the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under the map $q$. Then for any interval $I = (t_1, t_2]$ with $0 \leq t_1 < t_2 \leq 2\pi$, we have
$$
\mu(I) = d(F \circ q)(q^{-1}(I)) = F(q(t_1)) - F(q(t_2)) = F(t_1) - F(t_2).
$$
