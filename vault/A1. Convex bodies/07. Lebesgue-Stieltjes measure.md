For any right-continuous, real-valued function $F$ of bounded variation on domain $X = \mathbb{R}$ or $S^1 = \mathbb{R} / 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$, we will rigorously define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $dF$ that measures the difference of $F$ along the boundary of any measurable subset of $X$.

The standard statement on $dF$ that can be found in most analysis literature is the following.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous and monotonically increasing function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval].__ For any right-continuous function $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ such that $dF(a) = 0$ and for any half-open interval $(c, d] \subseteq [a, b]$, $dF\left( (c, d] \right) = F(d) - F(c)$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed-interval

_Proof._ Define the extension $F_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $F$ as $F_0(x) = F(a)$ for all $x < a$, $F_0(x) = F(b)$ for all $x > b$, and observe that $F_0$ is also right-continuous and bounded variation. Restrict the measure $dF_0$ on $\mathbb{R}$ to $[a, b]$ to construct $dF$. For the uniqueness of such $dF$, note that for any two candidates $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ of $dF$, the difference measure $\lambda = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ is zero for all half-open intervals $(c, d]$. Use Haan decomposition to represent $\lambda$ with positive and negative part. The positive and negative part all match on half-open intervals. So $\lambda$ is zero by Caratheodory extension. □

Define $q : [0, 2\pi] \to S^1$ as the quotient map $q(t) = t + 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ identifying $0$ and $2\pi$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-circle].__ For any right-continuous function $F : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ on $S^1$ such that for any half-open interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $t_1 < t_2 \leq t_1 + 2\pi$, we have $dF((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)$. Moreover, such $dF$ is the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under $q$.

_Proof._ We first show the existence of such $dF$. Let $\mu$ be the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under the map $q$. Then for any  □

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on either $S^1$ or a closed interval, so that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$.
