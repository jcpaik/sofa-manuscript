Let $\Theta$ be any finite angle set with rotation angle $\pi/2$. That is, $\Theta$ is a finite subset of $[0, \pi/2]$ containing the endpoints $0$ and $\pi/2$. Take any monotone sofa $S$ of maximum area with cap $K$. Then $S$ is approximated from above by the intersection of $H$ and $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in \Theta$. Call the intersection $S_\Theta$. Then $S_\Theta$ is a polygonal approximation of $S$ from above, and $S_\Theta$ is determined by the coordinates of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for $t \in \Theta$. In particular, it should be that the area of $S_\Theta$ has to be at least the area of Gerver's sofa.

Let $L$ be any linear combination of the coordinates of the inner corners $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for $t \in \Theta$. `SofaDesigner` is capable of providing lower and upper bounds of $L$. It does by analyzing the area of $S_\Theta$.

> __Theorem [sofa-designer-sample].__ If $\mathcal{A}_{\Theta^1}(K) \geq \mu_G$, then $p_K(\theta^1_j) - \mathbf{x}_K(\theta^1_i) \cdot u_j > 0.1$ for all $1 \leq i, j \leq 7$.  ^thm-sofa-designer-sample
