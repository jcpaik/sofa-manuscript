Recall that [[a. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] shows that a _balanced maximum sofa_ $S_{\infty}$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ exists. Such a sofa $S_{\infty}$ attains the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$, and is a monotone sofa with a _balanced maximum cap_ $K_{\infty}$. We refer the reader to review [[a. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]] for the precise statements. We will bound the arm lengths of a balanced maximum cap.

> __Theorem [balanced-arm-lengths].__ Fix an arbitrary balanced maximum cap $K := K_{\infty}$. For any $t \in [0, \pi/2)$, we have $f_K^+(t) = f_K^-(t) \geq 1$ and the equality holds only at $t = 0$. Likewise, for any $t \in (0, \pi/2]$, we have $g_K^+(t) = g_K^-(t) \geq 1$ and the equality holds only at $t = \pi/2$. ^thm-balanced-arm-lengths

A balanced maximum cap $K_\infty$ is the limit of _balanced polygon caps_ $K_1, K_2, \dots$ converging to $K$ in Hausdorff distance $d_\text{H}$. Each balanced polygon cap $K_i$ have angle set $\Theta_{n_i} := \left\{ (\pi/2) j / n_i : 1 \leq j < n_i \right\}$ with $n_i$ increasing powers of 2. To refer each polygon cap $K_i$ more easily, we introduce the following notion.

> __Definition [simple-notation-balanced-cap].__ Say that $K \in \mathcal{K}$ is a _balanced polygon cap_ with $n$ _steps_ of _step size_ $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$, if $n > 1$ and $n$ is a power of two, and $K$ is a balanced polygon cap with the angle set $\Theta_n := \left\{ (\pi/2) i / n : 1 \leq i < n \right\}$. ^def-simple-notation-balanced-cap

We will establish an upper bound of the surface area measure of a balanced polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps of step size $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$ ([[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]]). Then we will take the limit $n \to \infty$ (and accordingly $\delta \to 0$), so that the polygon cap $K$ converges to the balanced maximum cap $K_{\infty}$ satisfying the promised inequality. We use the following [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-o-notation]] to control error terms bounded by absolute functions of $\delta$.

> __Definition [o-notation].__ For any real-valued expressions $f$ and $g$ of $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$, write $f(\delta) = O_\delta(g(\delta))$ if the value of $g(\delta)$ depends solely on $\delta$, and there are absolute constants $C, \epsilon > 0$ such that for every $|\delta| < \epsilon$, we have $|f(\delta)| \leq C g(\delta)$. ^def-o-notation

Note that in [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-o-notation]], the value $f(\delta)$ might depend on other values than $\delta$, but the value of $g(\delta)$ should depend solely on $\delta$. For example, we can write $\delta^2 / (1 + p_K(0)^2) = O_\delta(\delta^2)$ where $K \in \mathcal{K}$ can be arbitrary, but we cannot write $\delta^2 = O_\delta(\delta^2(1+p_K(0)^2))$ as the value inside $O_\delta$ is not determined by $\delta$ only.

> __Lemma [leg-bounded].__ Any balanced polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps have the diameter at most $5$. Consequently, the functions $f_K^{\pm}$ and $g_K^{\pm}$ are bounded from above by 5, and the perimeter $\mathcal{H}^1(\partial K)$ is bounded from above by 20. ^lem-leg-bounded

_Proof._ Since $n > 1$ is a power of two by [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-simple-notation-balanced-cap]], the angle set $\Theta_n$ of $K$ contains the angle $\pi/4$. By [[a. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-cap-connected]], the cap $K$ satisfies the condition (1) of [[a. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Cap Contains Niche#^thm-monotonization-connected-iff]]. So the cap $K$ also satisfies the condition (3) of [[a. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Cap Contains Niche#^thm-monotonization-connected-iff]], and the $y$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/4)$ is at most one. Now $K \subseteq H \cap Q_K^+(\pi/4)$ and the polygon $H \cap Q_K^+(\pi/4)$ have diameter at most $2 + 2\sqrt{2} < 5$. So $K$ have the diameter at most 5. By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/05. Arm Lengths#^def-cap-tangent-arm-length]], for any $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ we have $A_K^{\pm}(t) - C_K^{\pm}(t) = - f_K^{\pm}(t) v_t + g_K^{\pm}(t) u_t$ and since $A_K^{\pm}(t), C_K^{\pm}(t)$ are in $K$, the values $f_K^{\pm}(t)$ and $g_K^{\pm}(t)$ are also bounded by the diameter of $K$ which is at most 5.

_Proof._ (1) See the left side of [[old/xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^fig-leg-computation]]. Let $p$ be the intersection of $\overline{d}_K(t - \delta)$ and $\overline{b}_K(t)$, depicted orange in the figure. Since $p \in \overline{b}_K(t)$, there is a unique real value $\alpha$ such that $p + \alpha v_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. As $b_K(t)$ is the half-line from $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ extending in the direction of $-v_t$, we have $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$ and it remains to evaluate $\alpha$. Define $q$ as the intersection of $\overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{d}_K(t)$, depicted green in the figure, and $\beta$ as the unique real value such that $q + \beta u_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. Since the points $p$, $q$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ form a right-angled triangle of angle $\delta$ at $q$, we have $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot \beta$. It remains to compute $\beta$.

Let $r$ be the intersection of $c_K(t - \delta)$ and $c_K(t)$, depicted blue in the figure. Since the lines $c_K(t)$ and $d_K(t)$ are parallel of distance one, and so are $c_K(t - \delta)$ and $d_K(t - \delta)$, and the two pairs of lines make an angle of $\delta$, follow the dashed lines in the figure and we get $r = q + v_t + \tan(\delta / 2) u_t$. As $K$ have angle set $\Theta$ and the angles $t$ and $t + \delta$ are adjacent, we have $r = C_K^-(t)$. By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/05. Arm Lengths#^lem-cap-tangent-arm-length]] we have $r + g_K^-(t) u_t = \mathbf{y}_K(t)$. Summing up, we now have
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta & = (\mathbf{x}_K(t) - q) \cdot u_t = (\mathbf{x}_K(t) + v_t + \tan(\delta/2) u_t - r) \cdot u_t \\
& = (\mathbf{x}_K(t) + v_t + \tan(\delta / 2) u_t - \mathbf{y}_K(t) + g_K^-(t)u_t) \cdot u_t \\
& = g_K^-(t) + \tan(\delta/2) - 1
\end{align*}
$$
and the result follows from $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, \beta)$.

(2) The proof is analogous to that of (1). See the right side of [[old/xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^fig-leg-computation]]. Let $p$ be the intersection of $\overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{b}_K(t)$. Since $p \in \overline{b}_K(t)$ there is a unique real value $\alpha$ such that $p + \alpha v_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. As $b_K(t)$ is the half-line from $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ extending in the direction of $-v_t$, we have $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t + \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$ and it remains to evaluate $\alpha$. Define $q$ as the intersection of $\overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{d}_K(t)$, and $\beta$ as the unique real value such that $\mathbf{x}_K(t) + \beta u_t = q$. Since the points $p$, $q$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ form a right-angled triangle of angle $\delta$ at $q$, we have $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot \beta$. It remains to compute $\beta$.

Let $r$ be the intersection of $c_K(t + \delta)$ and $c_K(t)$. Since the lines $c_K(t)$ and $d_K(t)$ are parallel of distance one, and so are $c_K(t + \delta)$ and $d_K(t + \delta)$, and the two pairs of lines make an angle of $\delta$, we have $r = q + v_t - \tan(\delta / 2) u_t$. As $K$ have angle set $\Theta$ and the angles $t$ and $t + \delta$ are adjacent, we have $r = C_K^+(t)$. By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/05. Arm Lengths#^lem-cap-tangent-arm-length]] we have $r + g_K^+(t) u_t = \mathbf{y}_K(t)$. Summing up, we now have
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta & = (q - \mathbf{x}_K(t)) \cdot u_t = (- \mathbf{x}_K(t) - v_t + \tan(\delta/2) u_t + r) \cdot u_t \\
& = (-\mathbf{x}_K(t) - v_t + \tan(\delta / 2) u_t + \mathbf{y}_K(t) - g_K^+(t)u_t) \cdot u_t \\
& = 1 - g_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta/2)
\end{align*}
$$
and the result follows from $\mathcal{H}^1(d_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{b}(t - \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, \beta)$. □

We introduce the following auxiliary real functions. Note that $m$ is monotonically increasing, and is a piecewise function that satisfies $m(0) = -1$, $m(1) = 1/2$, $m(x) = 1$ for $x \geq 2$.

> __Definition [magic-function].__ Define $k, m : \mathbb{R}_{\geq0} \to \mathbb{R}$ as $k(x) := \max\left( |x - 1|, (|x - 1| + 1) / 2 \right)$ and $m(x) = x - k(x)$. ^def-magic-function

We now bound each side length of a maximum polygon cap. This is the most important part of the analysis.

> __Lemma [balanced-discrete-ineq].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ be any balanced polygon cap of $n$ steps with step size $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$ and uniform angle set $\Theta := \Theta_n$. Take any $t \in \left\{ 0 \right\} \cup \Theta$. We have the following upper bound of side length $\sigma_K(t)$. ^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq
$$
\sigma_K(t) \leq k(g_K^+(t)) \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$

_Proof._ If $t = 0$, then $\sigma_K(t) = 0$ by the definition of $K$ so the inequality holds trivially. So we can assume $t \in \Theta$.

Write $s := \sigma_K(t)$. Recall that the balancedness condition of $K$ states that $s = \nu_K(t)$, where $\nu_K(t) := \mathcal{H}^1(X)$ is the length of the set $X := b_K(t) \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, the side(s) of the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ contributed by the half-line $b_K(t)$ form $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. We bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X)$ from above. Define the set $U := \left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\}$ and $R := \bigcup_{u \in U} H_K^\mathrm{d} (u)$ as the union of three half-planes. Divide $X$ into $X \cap R$ and $X \setminus R$. We bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ and $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ separately.

We first bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ from above. As $X \subseteq b_K(t)$, we have
$$
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) \leq \mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap R) = \max(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta), b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t + \delta))
$$
and by the computation in [[old/xd. Injectivity Hypothesis/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^lem-leg-computation]] and [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^lem-leg-bounded]], we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) & \leq \delta \cdot \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^+(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
\end{align*}
$$
Let $M = \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^+(t))$. We have $g_K^-(t) \leq g_K^+(t)$ by definition. So if $g_K^-(t) \leq 1$ then $M = \max(0, 1 - g_K^+(t)) \leq |1 - g_K^+(t)|$. If $g_K^-(t) > 1$ then we have $M = \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1) \leq |1 - g_K^+(t)|$. Either way, we have $M \leq |1 - g_K^+(t)|$ and ^eqn-bound-x-r
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) & \leq \left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2).
\end{align*}
$$

Now we bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ from above. Define the closed region $S := \bigcap_{u \in U} H_K^\mathrm{b} (u)$. Our intermediate goal is to show $X \setminus R \subseteq S$. Define $H_0 := H_+(\pi/2, 0)$ as the closed half-plane above the $x$-axis. Then, since $H_0 \cap \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is an open set, $H_0 \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is disjoint from $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. 

For every $u \in U$, we have $Q_K^-(u) \cup H_K^\mathrm{b}(u) \cup H_K^\mathrm{d}(u) = \mathbb{R}^2$. So
$$
X \subseteq H_0 \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \subseteq H_0 \setminus \bigcup_{u \in U} Q_K^-(u) \subseteq H_0 \cap \bigcap_{u \in U} (H_K^\mathrm{b}(u) \cup H_K^\mathrm{d}(u))
\subseteq H_0 \cap (R \cup S). 
$$

We just have shown that $X \setminus R \subseteq S$ where $S := \bigcap_{u \in U} H_K^\mathrm{b} (u)$ is the intersection of three closed half-planes with normal angles $u \in U$ and boundaries $\overline{b}_K(u)$. By definition of $X$, we have $X \subseteq \overline{b}_K(t)$ and $X \setminus R \subseteq \overline{b}_K(t) \cap S$. Define the intersections $B_+ := \overline{b}_K(t) \cap \overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $B_- := \overline{b}_K(t) \cap \overline{b}_K(t - \delta)$. There is a unique real value $\beta$ such that $B_+ = B_- - \beta v_t$. Elementary geometry shows that the side $\overline{b}_K(t) \cap S$ of $S$ is empty if $\beta < 0$, or is a finite segment of length $\beta$ if $\beta \geq 0$. On the other hand, XX shows that $\beta = 2 \tan (\delta / 2) - \sigma_K(t)$. So ^eqn-bound-x-not-r
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R) & \leq \max(0, 2 \tan (\delta / 2) - \sigma_K(t)) = \max(0, \delta - s) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
\end{align*}
$$

Recall that $s = \nu_K(t) = \mathcal{H}^1(X)$. We divide the proof into cases on whether $s \leq \delta$ or not. If $s \leq \delta$, then adding [[#^eqn-bound-x-r]] and [[#^eqn-bound-x-not-r]] gives
$$
s \leq \left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| \cdot \delta + \delta - s + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$
so rearranging gives
$$
s \leq (\left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| + 1)/2 \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2) \leq k(g_K^+(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
$$
On the other hand, if $s > \delta$, then adding [[#^eqn-bound-x-r]] and [[#^eqn-bound-x-not-r]] gives
$$
s \leq \left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2) \leq k(g_K^+(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
$$
Either way, the claimed inequality holds. □

> __Lemma [arm-length-discrete-bound].__ Let $K$ be any balanced polygon cap with $n$ steps of step size $\delta := (\pi/2) / n$ and angle set $\Theta := \Theta_n$. For any angle $t \in \left\{ 0 \right\} \cup \Theta$ and open interval $I := (t,t + \delta)$, the followings are true. ^lem-arm-length-discrete-bound
> 
> 1. For any $t' \in I$, we have $g_K^+(t) \geq g_K^{+}(t') = g_K^-(t') \geq g_K^-(t + \delta)$.
> 2. Moreover, the gap $g_K^+(t) - g_K^-(t + \delta)$ between the upper and the lower bound is at most $5 \delta$.

_Proof._ Since the angles $t$ and $t + \delta$ are two adjacent angles of the finite set $\left\{ 0, \pi/2 \right\} \cup \Theta$, we have
$$
A_K^+(t) = A_K^-(t + \delta) = A_K^+(t') = A_K^-(t')
$$
for all $t' \in I$. Call the common point $A$. Similarly, we have
$$
C_K^+(t) = C_K^-(t + \delta) = C_K^{+}(t') = C_K^{-}(t')
$$
for all $t' \in I$. Call the common point $C$. Take any $t' \in \overline{I} = [t, t + \delta]$. The lines $a_K(t')$ and $c_K(t')$ meet orthogonally at the point $\mathbf{y}_K(t')$. The line $a_K(t')$ passes through $A$, and the line $c_K(t')$ passes through $C$. So by elementary geometry, the trajectory of the point $\mathbf{y}_K(t')$ over all $t' \in \overline{I}$ forms an arc $\Delta$ of the circle $\Gamma$ with the diameter of length $\leq 5$ connecting $A$ and $C$. As the lines $a_K(t)$ and $a_K(t + \delta)$ makes an angle of $\delta$ at point $A$, the arc $\Delta$ have central angle $2\delta$ in $\Gamma$. The value $g_K^+(t)$ is the distance from $C$ to $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$, and $g_K^-(t + \delta)$ is the distance from $C$ to $\mathbf{y}_K(t + \delta)$. So (1) holds. The arc $\Delta$ connecting $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$ to $\mathbf{y}_K(t + \delta)$ has length at most $5\delta$. So (2) holds by triangle inequality. □

_Proof._ Let $\mu_K$ be the measure $k(g_K^+(t)) \, \mathrm{d} t$ on $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. It suffices to show ^eqn-to-show-interval
$$
\sigma_K(I) \leq \mu_K(I) = \int_{t \in I} k(g_K^+(t)) \, d t
$$
for any open interval $I = (a, b) \subseteq [0, \pi/2)$ and half-open interval $I = [0, b) \subseteq [0, \pi/2)$. Then for any set $U$ open in the subspace topology of $[0, \pi/2)$ is a countable union of such intervals, so we have $\sigma_K(U) \leq \int_{t \in U} k(g_K^+(t))\,dt$. Since both $\sigma_K$ and $k(g_K^+(t)) \mathrm{d} t$ are outer regular, by taking $U$ to converge to arbitrary Borel subset of $[0, \pi/2)$ we have $\sigma_K \leq k(g_K^+(t)) \, \mathrm{d} t$ on $[0,\pi/2)$.

$K$ is the limit of balanced polygon caps $K_n$ of $n$ steps with step size $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$ as $n \to \infty$, where $n = n_1, n_2, \dots$ takes values in a strictly increasing powers of two. Let $\Theta := \bigcup_n \Theta_n$ be the union of angle sets $\Theta_n$ for powers of two $n = n_1, n_2, \dots$, so that $\Theta$ is the set of dyadic angles in $(0, \pi/2)$. As $\Theta$ is dense in $[0, \pi/2)$, it suffices to show [[#^eqn-to-show-interval]] for $I = (a, b)$ and $I = [0, b)$ for $a, b \in \Theta$ with $a < b$ by taking limits.

Take sufficiently large $n$ so that we can assume $a, b \in \Theta_n$. For every $t \in \left\{ 0 \right\} \cup \Theta_n$, we can assume ^eqn-single-step-integral

$$
Here we use $|I \cap \Theta_n| \leq |\Theta_n| - 1 = n =  O_{\delta}(1/\delta)$. Take $n \to \infty$. Then as $K_n \to K$ in Hausdorff distance, $\sigma_{K_n} \to \sigma_K$ in the weak convergence of measures. Since $I$ is open in $S^1$, we have $\sigma_K(I) \leq \liminf_{ n } \sigma_{K_n}(I)$. On the other hand, by [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^lem-leg-convergence]] we have $\limsup_{ n } \mu_{K_n}(I) \leq \mu_K(I)$. So by taking $n \to \infty$ in [[#^eqn-polygon-integral]], we get $\sigma_K(I) \leq \mu_K(I)$ for $I = (a, b)$ as desired.

Similarly, for the interval $I := [0, b)$, set $a = 0$ and observe that [[#^eqn-polygon-integral]] still holds. Because $K_n$ and $K$ are caps, if we set $U = (-\pi/2, b)$ then we have $\sigma_{K_n}(I) = \sigma_{K_n}(U)$ and $\sigma_K(I) = \sigma_K(U)$. So we still have $\sigma_K(I) \leq \liminf_{ n } \sigma_{K_n}(I)$. We also have $\limsup_{ n } \mu_{K_n}(I) \leq \mu_K(I)$ by [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^lem-leg-convergence]]. So by taking $n \to \infty$ in [[#^eqn-polygon-integral]], we have $\sigma_K(I) \leq \mu_K(I)$ for $I = [0, b)$ as desired. □

> __Theorem [leg-length-bounds].__ Let $K$ be a balanced maximum cap. Then $f_K^+(t) = f_K^-(t)$ on $t \in [0, \pi/2)$ and the common value $f_K(t)$ is absolutely continuous on $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. Similarly, $g_K^+(t) = g_K^-(t)$ on $t \in (0, \pi/2]$ and the common value $g_K(t)$ is absolutely continuous on $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. Also, we have $f'_K(t) \leq m(g_K^+(t))$ almost everywhere. ^thm-leg-length-bounds

_Proof._ By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^lem-balanced-ineq-limit]] and the Radon-Nikodym theorem, we have $\sigma_K = s_K(t) \mathrm{d} t$ for some measurable function $s_K : [0, \pi/2) \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ that is unique up to null set. Since $\sigma_K \leq k(g_K^+(t)) \mathrm{d} t$, we can assume $s_K \leq g_K^+$. By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/05.

By mirror symmetry, any lower bound $f_n(t)$ of $f_K(t)$ gives a lower bound $f_{n}(\pi/2-t)$ of $g_K(t)$. [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^thm-leg-length-bounds]] then transfers any lower bound of $g_K(t)$ to a lower bound of $f_K'(t)$. Integrating $f_K'(t)$ and its lower bound $m(f_{n}(\pi/2-t))$, we obtain a new lower bound $f_{n+1}(t)$ of $f_K(t)$. Let us now iterate this indefinitely to get a good lower bound of $f_K$ ([[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^lem-lower-bound-sequence]]).

> __Lemma [lower-bound-sequence].__ The following holds for any $n \geq 0$. Let $K \in \mathcal{K}$ be any balanced maximum cap. Then we have $f_K(t) \geq f_n(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$ and $g_K(t) \geq f_n(\pi/2 - t)$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. ^lem-lower-bound-sequence

_Proof._ Induct on $n$. The base case $n \geq 0$ holds trivially. Now assume the inductive hypothesis that for any balanced maximum cap $K'$, we have $f_{K'}(t) \geq f_n(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$ and $g_{K'}(t) \geq f_n(\pi/2 - t)$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. Fix any balanced maximum cap $K$. For any $t \in [0, \pi/2)$, we have
$$
f_K(t) = f_K(0) + \int_0^t f_K'(u) \,du \geq f_K(0) + \int_0^t m(g_K(u)) \,du \geq f_K(0) + \int_0^t m(f_K(\pi/2 - u)) \,du 
$$
by the inductive hypothesis on $K' := K$ and [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^thm-leg-length-bounds]]. This combined with the inductive hypothesis $f_{K}(t) \geq f_n(t)$ on $K' := K$ implies that $f_K(t) \geq f_{n+1}(t)$.

From the inductive hypothesis, we proved $f_K(t) \geq f_{n+1}(t)$ for any balanced maximum cap $K$ and $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. Applying the same argument to $K' := K^{\mathrm{op}}$, we also have $f_{K^\mathrm{\mathrm{op}}}(t) \geq f_{n+1}(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. This by XX is equivalent to the other inequality $g_K(t) \geq f_{n+1}(\pi/2 - t)$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2]$. □

> __Lemma [lower-bound-limit].__ Define $f_{\infty} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ as the pointwise limit $f_\infty(x) = \lim_{ _{n \to \infty} } f_n(x)$. Then $f_{\infty}$ is well-defined, bounded, continuous, and satisfies $f_{\infty}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{\infty}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. ^lem-lower-bound-limit

_Proof._ By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-lower-bound-sequence]], for any $x \in [0, \pi/2]$ the sequence $f_n(x)$ with index $n$ is monotonically increasing. As the function $m$ is bounded from above by $1$, by [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-lower-bound-sequence]] we have the global upper bound $f_n(x) \leq 1 + x$ for any $x \in [0, \pi/2]$ and $n \geq 0$. So the function $f_{\infty} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ is well-defined. By Dini's theorem, 

We now show that for any $n \geq 1$ and $x \in (0, \pi/2]$, we have the strict inequality $f_{n+1}(x) > f_n(x)$. The base case $n = 1$ have to be checked manually. By calculation, we have $f_1(x) = 1 -x$ for all $x \leq 1$ and $f_1(x) = 0$ for all $x > 1$. Also by calculation, we have

- $f_2(x) = 1 - x$ for all $x \leq \pi/2 - 1$,
- $f_2(x) = 2 - \pi/2 + \int_{\pi/2 - 1}^x \left( 3/2 () -1 \right) \,du$ for all $\pi/2 - 1 \leq x \leq 1$,
- $f_2(x) = $ for all $x \geq 1$.

Now assume the inductive hypothesis that $f_{n+1}(x) > f_n(x)$ for all $x \in (0, \pi/2]$. By [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-lower-bound-sequence]] we have $f_{n+1}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. Since $f_n$'s are globally bounded by 2, and the function $m$ is strictly increasing on the domain $[0, 2]$, we have
$$
1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n+1}(\pi/2 - u))\, du > 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n}(\pi/2 - u))\, du = f_{n+1}(x)
$$
for all $x > 0$ by the inductive hypothesis. So the left-hand side is equal to $f_{n+2}(x)$ by [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^def-lower-bound-sequence]], and we prove $f_{n+2}(x) > f_{n+1}(x)$ as desired.

Since $f_{n+1}(x) > f_n(x)$ for all $x \in (0, \pi/2]$, we have $f_{n+1}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{n}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. Now take $n \to \infty$ and obtain $f_{\infty}(x) = 1 + \int_0^x m(f_{\infty}(\pi/2 - u))\, du$. □

We now move on to computing $f_{\infty}$ explicitly. We rely on `Mathematica` to check the following calculation; this could be checked rigorously using interval arithmetic if desired.

> __Proposition [lower-bound-constants].__ There exists unique constants $A_0 \in [0.95, 0.96]$, $B_0 \in [2.31, 2.32]$, $T_0 \in [0.50, 0.51]$ satisfying the following equations. ^pro-lower-bound-constants

> 3. and $f_{\infty}(\pi/2-T_0)=2$ and $f_{\infty}'(t) = (\pi/2 - t + 1)/2$ for $t \in [\pi/2 - T_0, \pi/2]$.

_Proof._ We first show that there is a unique differentiable function $f : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following time-reversal delayed ODE.
$$
\begin{gather*}
f(0) = 1 \\
f'(x) = m(f(\pi/2-x))
\end{gather*}
$$
Let $e(x) = f(\pi/2 - x)$. Then the ODE is equivalent to:
$$
\begin{gather*}
f(0) = 1 \qquad f'(x) = m(e(x)) \\
e(\pi/2) = 1 \qquad e'(x) = -m(f(x))
\end{gather*}
$$
As the value of $m$ is bounded in $[-1, 1]$, for any initial condition $(e(0), f(0)) = (C, 1)$ with $C \in \mathbb{R}$ we have a unique global solution $e, f : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying (i) and (ii). Moreover, as $C$ increases, 

Now it suffices to check that the suggested function $f = f_{\infty}$ indeed satisfies the equality $f'(x) = m(f(\pi/2-x))$. Check the followings in order.

1. The values of $f(t)$ on $t \in [0, T_0]$ range from $1$ to $1 + T_0$.
2. By (1) and (2) of [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity of Balanced Maximum Sofa/10. Bounding Arm Lengths#^pro-lower-bound-constants]], the values of $f(t)$ on $t \in [T_0, \pi/2 - T_0]$ range from $1+T_0$ to 2.
3. By the definition of $f$, the values of $f(t)$ on $t \in [\pi/2 - T_0, \pi/2]$ is at least 2.

So we have $m(f(t)) = sss$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2 - T_0]$ and $m(f(t)) = 1$ on $t \in [\pi/2 - T_0, \pi/2]$. Checking $f'(x) = m(f(\pi/2-x))$ is now calculation that we omit. □
