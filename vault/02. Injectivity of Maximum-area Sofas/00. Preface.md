The _moving sofa problem_ asks for the connected shape $S$ with the largest area $\alpha$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. Gerver derived a sofa $S_G$ of conjectually optimum area $2.2195\dots$, using an important idea that a maximum-area shape $S$ should be the intersection of $L_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, where each $L_t$ is a copy of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by angle $t$ located at the position $\mathbf{x}(t)$. A major obstacle for proving the global optimality of $S_G$ is that there is no tractable formula of $\alpha = \alpha(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of the locations $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of rotated hallways $L_t$. Gerver's derivation assumes five stages of movement of $L_t$ to execute local optimality argument, but it is not shown that such five stages should happen.

In this paper, we show that there exists a shape $S$ of the maximum area $\alpha$ satisfying a technical property that enables us to write a large portion of the contribution of $\mathbf{x}$ towards $\alpha$ via Green's theorem. This will be used in
