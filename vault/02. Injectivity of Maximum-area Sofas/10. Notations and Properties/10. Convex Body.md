We will use all the notations defined in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/04. Notations/00. Preface]]. We quickly summarize important definitions and conventions; see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/04. Notations/00. Preface]] for their full details.

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a Borel measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively.

The set $S^1$ denotes $\mathbb{R}$ modulo $2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$.

A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. For any convex body $K$, its _support function_ $h_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value
$$
h_S(t) := \sup \left\{ s \cdot u_t : s \in S \right\}.
$$
The _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is the intersection $K \cap l_K(t)$.

The _one-dimensional Hausdorff measure_ $\mathcal{H}^1$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ measures the length of any line segments and curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The _surface area measure_ $\sigma_K$ of a convex body $K$ is defined, so that for any Borel subset $X$ of $S^1$, $\sigma_K(X)$ is equal to the total length $\mathcal{H}^1(Y)$ of the union $Y := \bigcup_{t \in X} e_K(t)$ of edges of $K$ with normal angles in $X$.

We add the following definition.

> __Definition [convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection].__ For every $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 \neq t_1,  t_1 + \pi$, define $v_K(t_1, t_2)$ as the intersection $l_K(t_1) \cap l_K(t_2)$. ^def-convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection

We prove a technical lemma on the limit of vertices of $K$.

> __Theorem [limits-converging-to-vertex].__ Let $K$ be any convex body and $t \in S^1$ be an arbitrary angle. We have the following right limits all converging to $v_K^+(t)$. In particular, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is a right-continuous function on $t \in S^1$. ^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex
$$
\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^+(t) = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K(t, t') = v_K^+(t)
$$
> Similarly, we have the following left limits.
$$
\lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K^+(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K^-(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K(t', t) = v_K^-(t)
$$

_Proof._ We only compute the right limits. Left limits can be shown using a symmetric argument.

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Let $p = v_K^+(t) + \epsilon v_t$. By the definition of $v_K^+(t)$, the point $p$ is not in $K$. As $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus K$ is open, we can take some positive $\epsilon' < \epsilon$ such that the closed line segment $s$ connecting $p$ and $q = p - \epsilon' u_t$ is disjoint from $K$ as well. Define the closed right-angled triangle $T$ with vertices $v_K^+(t)$, $p$, and $q$. Take the line $l$ that passes through both $q$ and $v_K^+(t)$. Call the two closed half-planes divided by the line $l$ as $H_T$ and $H'$, where $H_T$ contains $p$ and $H'$ does not contain $p$. By definition, $H'$ has normal angle $t' \in (t, t + \pi/2)$.

We show that $K \cap H_T \subseteq T$. Observe that the intersection $X := H_K(t) \cap H_T$ is a cone centered at the point $v_K^+(t)$, with the line segment $s$ dividing $X$ into triangle $T$ and an unbounded convex set $X \setminus T$. Now take any point $r \in K \cap H_T$. If $r \not\in T$, then since $r \in X \setminus T$ and $v_K^+(t) \in T$ the line connecting $r \in K$ and $v_K^+(t) \in K$ should pass through a point in $s$. This, however, contradicts that $s$ is disjoint from convex $K$. So we have $r \in T$ and thus $K \cap H_T \subseteq T$.

Now take arbitrary $t_0 \in (t, t')$. We show that the edge $e_K(t_0)$ should lie inside $T$. It suffices to show that any point $z$ in $K$ that attains the maximum value of $z \cdot u_{t_0}$ is in $T$. Define the fan $F := g_K(t) \cap H'$, so that $F$ is bounded by lines $l_K(t)$ and $l$ with the vertex $v_K^+(t)$. If $z \in F$, it should be that $z = v_K^+(t) \in T$, because $v_K^+(t) \in K$ and $v_K^+(t) \cdot u_{t_0} > z \cdot u_{t_0}$ for every point $z$ in $F$ other than $z = v_K^+(t)$. If $z \in K \setminus F$ on the other hand, we have $K \setminus F = K \setminus H' \subseteq K \cap H_T \subseteq T$ so $z \in T$. This completes the proof of $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$.

Observe that the triangle $T$ contains $v_K^+(t)$ and has diameter $< 2\epsilon$ because the two perpendicular sides of $T$ containing $p$ have length $\leq \epsilon$. So the endpoints $v_K^+(u)$ and $v_K^-(u)$ of the edge $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$ are distance at most $2\epsilon$ away from $v_K^+(t)$. This completes the epsilon-delta argument for $\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^+(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^-(t') = v_K^+(t)$. 

From $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$ and that the vertex $p$ of $T$ maximizes the value of $z \cdot u_{t_0}$ over all $z \in T$, we get that $p$ is either on $l_K(t_0)$ or outside the half-plane $g_K(t_0)$. On the other hand we have $v_K^+(t) \in g_K(t_0)$. So the line $l_K(t_0)$ passes through the segment connecting $p$ and $v_K^+(t)$, and the intersection $v_K(t, t_0) = l_K(t) \cap l_K(t_0)$ is inside $T$. This with that the diameter of $T$ is less than $2 \epsilon$ proves $\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K(t, t') = v_K^+(t)$. â–¡
