Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

In 1992, Gerver constructed a sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). It is conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum area. To derive the sofa $S_G$, Gerver In particular, [[old/xx. Mamikon's Theorem/00. Preface]] showed that there is a maximum-area sofa which is both _monotone_ and _balanced_. 

A sofa is _monotone_ if it is the intersection of rotated hallways. in convex position; that is, the outer walls of rotating hallways form the supporting lines of a convex body $K$. A monotone sofa can be built from $K$, called the _cap_ of $S$, by removing the portion of $K$ carved out by the inner corner. 
A sofa is _balanced_ if it is the ...

A major obstacle in showing that $S_G$ is globally optimum is that there is no single formula of the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ of the sofa with respect to the rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ to work with. All known derivations of Gerver's sofa assumes without proof that a moving sofa of maximum area follows five specific stages. Without relying on such assumption, we prove the following theorem that will enable us to optimize

> __Theorem [well-behaved].__ There exists a maximum-area monotone sofa $S_{\max}$ such that its rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable, and we have $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t > 0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t < 0$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$. ^thm-well-behaved

It is easy to see that [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-well-behaved]], in particular, 

It is plausible that a maximum-area moving sofa is at least sufficiently close to Gerver's sofa, and that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ has no self-intersection. Once this is done, the area carved out by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is expressible using Green's theorem, so that it is more prone to optimization techniques. We indeed show that a maximum-area sofa has no self-intersection.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ A limiting maximum monotone sofa $S$ have $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of no self-intersection. ^thm-injectivity

This is related to an assumption of Romik (the first condition of 'well-behaved' in p321 of [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]) that he used to derive Gerver's sofa $S_G$.



We show this by one-sided balancedness that holds no matter the contact types are.
