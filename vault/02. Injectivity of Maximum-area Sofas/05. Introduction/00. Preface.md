Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

In 1992, Gerver constructed a sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). It is conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum area. To derive the sofa $S_G$, Gerver In particular, [[old/xx. Mamikon's Theorem/00. Preface]] showed that there is a maximum-area sofa which is both _monotone_ and _balanced_. 

A sofa is _monotone_ if it is the intersection of rotated hallways. in convex position; that is, the outer walls of rotating hallways form the supporting lines of a convex body $K$. A monotone sofa can be built from $K$, called the _cap_ of $S$, by removing the portion of $K$ carved out by the inner corner. 
A sofa is _balanced_ if it is the ...

One major challenge in solving the moving sofa problem exactly, is that there is no definite formula of the area of the sofa (with respect to $\mathbf{x}(t)$) to begin with. A pontential formula will change for each contact point. Gerver and Romik makes an assumption that a moving sofa of maximum area follows five stages in the beginning, to be able to execute a local optimization. We prove the following theorem that will enable us to optimize

> __Theorem [well-behaved].__ A limiting maximum monotone sofa $S$. Then the rotation path $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is continuously differentiable with respect to $t$, and it satisfies $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t > 0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t < 0$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$. ^thm-well-behaved

It is plausible that a maximum-area moving sofa is at least sufficiently close to Gerver's sofa, and that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ has no self-intersection. Once this is done, the area carved out by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is expressible using Green's theorem, so that it is more prone to optimization techniques. We indeed show that a maximum-area sofa has no self-intersection.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ A limiting maximum monotone sofa $S$ have $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of no self-intersection. ^thm-injectivity

This is related to an assumption of Romik (the first condition of 'well-behaved' in p321 of [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]) that he used to derive Gerver's sofa $S_G$.



We show this by one-sided balancedness that holds no matter the contact types are.
