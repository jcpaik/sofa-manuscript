Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

In 1992, Gerver constructed a sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] which is conjectured to attain the maximum area (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). An important idea of Gerver is that a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ should be the intersection of hallways $L_t$, each rotated counterclockwise by the angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ and translated (depicted as grey outlines in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). Let $\mathbf{x}_L := (0, 0)$ be the inner corner of $L$. For each $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, define $\mathbf{x}(t)$ as the inner corner of $L_t$ corresponding to the inner corner of $L$. Then the curve $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, called the _rotation path_ by Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018], determines the moving sofa $S$ and its area $\alpha = \alpha(\mathbf{x})$. Gerver's sofa $G$ is derived so that any small perturbation of the rotation path $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_G$ of Gerver's sofa does not increase the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$.

A major obstacle in showing the global optimality of $G$ is that there is no managable formula of the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ of the sofa that works for all rotation paths $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. All known derivations of $G$ assumes the movement of five specific stages in order to find a workable formula for the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$. In this paper, we prove the following theorem without any such assumption.

> __Definition [unit-vectors].__ Define $u_t = (\cos t, \sin t)$ and $v_t = (-\sin t, \cos t)$. ^def-unit-vectors

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ There exists a maximum-area monotone sofa $S_{\max}$ such that its rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable, and we have $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t < 0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t > 0$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$. ^thm-injectivity

We call the condition in [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] the _injectivity condition_ on $S_{\max}$. This is because [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] implies that the rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and thus have no self-intersection. To see this, observe that
$$
\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot (1, 0) = \cos t \; (\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t) - \sin t \; (\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t) < 0
$$
for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$ so that the $x$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}(t)$ strictly decreases as $t$ increases. So the trajectory of $\mathbf{x}(t)$ forms a Jordan arc with no self-intersection. The portion of the area carved out by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ can be then expressed using Green's theorem. This property will be used in the next work to establish an upper bound of $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ with an workable formula.

> __Remark [injectivity].__ Romik assumed the condition in [[#^thm-injectivity]] to give a streamlined derivation of Gerver's sofa (page 321 of [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]). In particular, Romik notes that the condition 'is likely to be true'. ^rem-injectivity
