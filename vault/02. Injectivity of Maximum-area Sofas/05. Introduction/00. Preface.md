Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

In 1992, Gerver constructed a sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] which is conjectured to attain the maximum area (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). An important idea of Gerver is that a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ should be the intersection of rotated hallways $L_t$ of angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ each located at the position $\mathbf{x}(t)$ (depicted as grey outlines in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). That is, for each $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, there is a hallway $L_t$ which is a copy of $L$ rotated and translated, so that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_L := (0, 0)$ of $L$ corresponds to the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of $L_t$. The area $\alpha$ of the sofa $S$ is now a function $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ of the curve $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, called the _rotation path_ by Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]. Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is derived so that the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ never increases under small perturbations of the rotation path $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_G$ of Gerver's sofa.

A major obstacle in showing the global optimality of $S_G$ is that there is no managable formula of the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ of the sofa that works for all possible rotation paths $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. All known derivations of $S_G$ assumes a movement of $S$ in five specific stages in order to find a workable formula of $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$. In this paper, we prove the following theorem without any such assumption.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ There exists a maximum-area monotone sofa $S_{\max}$ such that its rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable, and we have $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t > 0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t < 0$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$. ^thm-injectivity

We call the condition in [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] the _injectivity condition_ on $S_{\max}$. The reason is that [[02. Injectivity of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] implies the injectivity of the rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ in particular. To see this, observe that
$$
\mathbf{x}(t) \cdot (1, 0) = \cos^2 t \; (\mathbf{x}(t) \cdot u_t) - \sin^2 t \; (\mathbf{x}(t) \cdot v_t) < 0
$$
for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$ so that the $x$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}(t)$ strictly decreases as $t$ increases. So this condition shows that the trajectory of $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is a Jordan arc with no self-intersection. The portion of the area carved out by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ can be expressed using Green's theorem.

> __Remark [injectivity].__ The inequality in [[#^thm-injectivity]] is an assumption of Romik made in page 321 of [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]. In particular, Romik notes that the condition 'is likely to be true'. ^rem-injectivity
