Let $\mathcal{P}_0$ be a collection of polygons, either finite or infinite. The _Kakeya problem_ on $\mathcal{P}$ asks for the minimum-area union $\bigcup_{P \in \mathcal{P}} (P + \mathbf{x}_P)$ of the translates of $P \in \mathcal{P}$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}_P$. The _inverse Kakeya problem_ on $\mathcal{P}$ asks for the maximum-area intersection $\bigcap_{P \in \mathcal{P}} (P + \mathbf{x}_P)$.

The original Kakeya needle problem is recovered when $\mathcal{P}$ is the collection of rotating needles.

The moving sofa problem is $\mathcal{P}$ is the maximum-area intersection problem on the infinite collection of $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and the rotating hallways $R_t(L)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$. We use this general framework to the moving sofa problem, and use domain-specific knowledge on the moving sofa problem to effectively.
