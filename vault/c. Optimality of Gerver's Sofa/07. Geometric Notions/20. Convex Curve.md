> __Definition [convex-curve].__ For any planar convex body $K$ and $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary such that $a < b < a + \pi$, define the segment of the boundary of $K$ ^def-convex-curve

\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b} := \left\{ v_K^+(a) \right\} \cup \bigcup_{t \in (a, b)} e_K(t) \cup \left\{ v_K^-(b) \right\}.

> __Lemma [convex-curve-triangle].__ If $v_K^+(a) = v_K^-(b)$, then $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$ is the single point $v_K^+(a)$. Otherwise, the three points $v_K^+(a), v_K^-(b), v_K(a, b)$ are different from each other and the set $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$ is inside the triangle formed by three points. ^lem-convex-curve-triangle

> __Lemma [convex-curve-cut].__ Define $l'$ as the line passing through $v_K^+(a)$ and $v_K^-(b)$. Define $H'$ as the half-plane with $l'$ as the boundary. Normal angle $t'$ outside the interval $(a, b)$. Define $K' = K \cap H'$. Then $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b} = \mathbf{u}_{K'}^{a, b}$. $e_K$ and $e_{K'}$ the same, or one line segment for $t'$, or point. Also, the boundary of $K'$ is a Jordan curve which is the join of $\mathbf{u}_{K'}^{a, b}$ and the line segment $e_{K'}(t')$. ^lem-convex-curve-cut

> __Proposition [convex-curve-parametrization].__ The set $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$ in [[c. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Geometric Notions/20. Convex Curve#^def-convex-curve]] is a rectifiable Jordan curve from $v_K^+(a)$ to $v_K^-(b)$. ^pro-convex-curve-parametrization

_Proof._ It suffices to supply a rectifiable parametrization of $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$ (talk about basics of Jordan arcs).

By rotating $K$ by a clockwise angle of $t$, we can change the interval from $(a, b)$ to $(a - t, b - t)$ without loss of generality. Now by setting $t = (a+b)/2$, we can assume $a = -b$ and $-\pi/2 < a < 0 < b < \pi/2$ without loss of generality.

Define $c$ as the $y$-coordinate of $v_K^+(a)$, and $d$ as the $y$-coordinate of $v_K^-(b)$. By XX, the points $v_K^+(a), v_K(a, b), v_K^-(b)$ are listed in a monotonically increasing order of its $y$-coordinates. So we have $c \leq d$ in particular. For any $s \in [c, d]$, define $x(s)$ as the largest $x$-coordinate of the horizontal segment $K \cap l(\pi/2, s)$. Define $X := \left\{ (s, x(s)) : s \in [c, d] \right\}$. We will show that the set $X$ is the set $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$ we want to parametrize, and that $(s, x(s))$ is a rectifiable parametrization.

Endpoint conditions $v_K^+(a) = (c, x(c))$ and $v_K^-(b) = (d, x(d))$. The line $l(\pi/2, c)$ passes through $v_K^+(a)$ by the definition of $c$. Since $v_K^+(a) \in K \subseteq H_K(a)$, the line segment $K \cap l(\pi/2, s) \subseteq H_K(a) \cap l(\pi/2, s)$, and the latter one have $v_K^+(a)$ at the rightmost point. 

We first show $X = \mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$. Show $X \subseteq \partial K$. It confines to definition of boundary. Now take any $p \in X$ so that $p \in e_K(t)$ for some $t \in S^1$. 


Take any point $p = (x(s), s)$. This is on the boundary of $K$. By the property of $K$, it has a supporting line passing through $p$.  □

$$
\mathcal{I}\left( \mathbf{u}_K^{a, b} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{t \in (a, b)}h_K(t)\, \sigma_K(dt).
$$

_Proof._ Define $H'$ as the half-plane with boundary passing through the endpoints of the convex curve $\mathbf{u}$. Define the intersection $K \cap H'$. Its boundary is $\mathbf{u}_K^{a, b}$ followed by the line segment connecting $v_K^+(b)$ to $v_K^-(a)$ 

Handle $K'$ degenerate case.
