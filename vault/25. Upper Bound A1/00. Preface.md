We prove the main [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^thm-main-cap]] in this section. We do this by constructing an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}$ as described in the introduction.

[[01. Definition of A1]] defines $\mathcal{A}_1$ and shows that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is indeed an upper bound of $\mathcal{A}$. [[25. Upper bound A1/03. A1 is quadratic]] establishes that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a quadratic functional on its domain $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. [[25. Upper bound A1/10. Concavity of A1]] proves that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave, so that a local optimum of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is also a global optimum of $\mathcal{A}_1$. [[25. Upper bound A1/15. Directional derivative of A1]] calculates the directional derivative of $\mathcal{A}_1$. Finally, [[20. Maximizer of A1]] finds the maximizer $K = K_{\omega, 1}$ of $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ by solving for the condition where directional derivative is always zero.

[[20. Maximizer of A1#^thm-maximum-presofa-a1-area]] evaluates the maximum value $\mathcal{A}_1(K_{\omega, 1}) = 1 + \omega^2/2$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$, completing the proof of [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^thm-main-cap]]. Then by [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^cor-main-cap]] we also prove [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] stated in the introduction.
