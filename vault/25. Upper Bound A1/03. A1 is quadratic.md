Here, we observe that $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is quadratic.

The _surface area measure_ $\beta_K$ of $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ is very helpful in establishing [[03. A1 is quadratic#^thm-a1-quadratic]] and understanding $\mathcal{A}_1$ in general. Also, we will establish a correspondence between any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ and its surface area measure $\beta_K$ ([[03. A1 is quadratic#^thm-boundary-measure-cap]] and [[03. A1 is quadratic#^thm-cap-from-boundary-measure]]).

# Convex-linear values of cap

Observe that a lot of values defined on the cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ is convex-linear with respect to $K$.

> __Theorem [cap-convex-linear].__ The following values are convex-linear with respect to $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$. ^thm-cap-convex-linear
> 
> - Support function $p_K$
> - Vertices $A^{\pm}_K(t)$ and $C^{\pm}_K(t)$ for a fixed $t \in [0, \omega]$
> - The inner and outer corner $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ and $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$ of the tangent hallway with any angle $t \in [0, \omega]$
> - The points $W_K(t)$, $Z_K(t)$ and the values $w_K(t)$, $z_K(t)$ for a fixed $t \in (0, \omega)$
> - The perpendicular leg lengths $g^{\pm}_K(t)$ and $h^{\pm}_K(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$

_Proof._ Use [[05. Vertex and support function#^pro-support-function-linear]] for $p_K$, [[05. Vertex and support function#^cor-vertex-right-continuous]] for $A^{\pm}_K(t)$ and $C^{\pm}_K(t)$, [[05. Vertex and support function#^def-convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection]] for $\mathbf{y}_K(t), W_K(t)$, and $Z_K(t)$. Use the equality $\mathbf{y}_K(t) = \mathbf{x}_K(t) + u_t + v_t$ for $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$, the equalities in [[15. Cap contains niche#^def-wedge-side-lengths]] for $w_K(t)$ and $z_K(t)$, and the equalities in [[01. Definition of A1#^def-cap-tangent-arm-length]] for $g^{\pm}_K(t)$ and $h^{\pm}_K(t)$. □

[[03. A1 is quadratic#^thm-cap-convex-linear]] in particular establishes that the curve area functional $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$ ([[01. Definition of A1#^def-curve-area-functional]]) is quadratic with respect to $K$.

# Surface area measure

A key component in our analysis of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is the _surface area measure_ $\beta_K$ of a planar convex body $K$ (defined in p214, and denoted as either $S_1(K, -)$ or $S_K$ in p464 of [[@schneider_2013]]). $\beta_K$ is a measure on $S^1$ that essentially measures the side lengths of $K$. For example, if $K$ is a convex polygon, then $\beta_K$ is a discrete measure such that the measure $\beta_K\left( \left\{ t \right\} \right)$ at point $t$ is the length of the edge $e_K(t)$. On the other hand, assume the other case where for every $t \in S^1$ the tangent line $l_K(t)$ meets $K$ at a single point $v(t)$, so that $\partial K$ is parametrized smoothly by $v_K(t)$ for $t \in S^1$. Then it turns out that $\beta_K(dt) = R(t) dt$ where $R(t) = \left\lVert v'(t) \right\rVert$ is the radius of curvature of $\partial K$ at $v(t)$. A full treatment on $\beta_K$ needed for this paper is done in [[10. Surface area measure]]. In particular, by [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-surface-area-measure-area]] we have the following.

> __Corollary [area-quadratic-functional].__ The area $|K|$ of a cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\omega}$ is a quadratic functional on $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ ^cor-area-quadratic-functional

Now [[03. A1 is quadratic#^thm-a1-quadratic]] is a consequence of [[03. A1 is quadratic#^cor-inner-corner-quadratic]] and [[03. A1 is quadratic#^cor-area-quadratic-functional]].

Gauss-Minkowski theorem ([[20. Normal angles#^thm-gauss-minkowski]]) states that any convex set $K$, up to translation, corresponds one-to-one to a measure $\beta = \beta_K$ on $S^1$ such that $\int_{S^1}u_t\,\beta(dt) = 0$. Using this correspondence, we can always construct a cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ from a measure $\beta$ on the set $J_\omega$.

> __Definition [j-cap].__ For any $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the set $J_\omega = [0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]$. ^def-j-cap

> __Theorem [boundary-measure-cap].__ For any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$, its surface area measure $\beta_K$ satisfies the followings. ^thm-boundary-measure-cap
$$
\int_{t \in [0, \omega]} \cos(t) \, \beta_K(dt) = 1 \qquad \int_{t \in [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]} \cos\left( \omega + \pi/2 - t \right)  \, \beta_K(dt) = 1
$$

_Proof._ By the second condition of [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^def-cap]] and [[20. Normal angles#^thm-convex-set-support]], we have $\mathbf{n}(K) \subseteq J_\omega \cup \left\{ \pi + \omega, 3\pi/2 \right\}$. Now by [[20. Normal angles#^thm-convex-set-support-disjoint]], that $(-\pi/2, 0)$ is disjoint from $\Pi$ implies that the point $A_K^-(0)$ is on the line $l_K(3\pi/2)$ which is $y=-1$. Likewise, that $(\omega, \pi/2)$ is disjoint from $\Pi$ implies that the point $A_K^+(\omega)$ is on the line $l_K(\pi/2)$ which is $y=0$. By [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-boundary-measure-closed]] we have
$$
\int_{t \in [0, \omega]} v_t \, \beta_K(dt) = A^+_K(\omega) - A^-_K(0)
$$
and by taking the dot product with $v_0$ we have the first equality. The second equality can be proved similarly by  □

> __Theorem [cap-from-boundary-measure].__ Take arbitrary $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Conversely to [[#^thm-boundary-measure-cap]], let $\beta$ be a measure on $J_\omega$ that satisfies the following equations. ^thm-cap-from-boundary-measure
$$
\int_{t \in [0, \omega]} \cos(t) \, \beta(dt) = 1 \qquad \int_{t \in [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]} \cos\left( \omega + \pi/2 - t \right)  \, \beta(dt) = 1
$$
> Then there exists a cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ such that $\beta_K|_{J_\omega} = \beta$. Such $K$ is unique if $\omega < \pi/2$, and unique up to horizontal translation if $\omega = \pi/2$.

_Proof._ We first show that there is a unique extension of $\beta$ on the set $\Pi = J_\omega \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$ such that $\int_{t \in \Pi} v_t \, \beta(dt) = 0$. We 

If $\omega = \pi/2$, then by the two equations in the statement we have $\int_{t \in [0, \pi]} \cos(t)\,\beta(dt) = 0$. So 


Let $A = \int_{t \in [0, \omega]}\sin(t)\,\beta(dt) \geq 0$, then we have $\int_{t \in [0, \omega]} v_t \,\beta(dt) = - A u_0 + v_0$ by the first condition of the theorem statement. Likewise, if we let $B = \int_{t \in [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]} \sin(\omega + \pi/2 - t)\,\beta(dt) \geq 0$, then we have $\int_{t \in [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]}v_t\,\beta(dt) = B v_\omega - u_\omega$. By solving for $\int_{t \in \Pi} v_t \, \beta(dt) = 0$, we get the unique extension of $\beta$ to $\Pi$ with $\int_{t \in \Pi} v_t \, \beta(dt) = 0$ defined as the following.

- If $\omega = \pi/2$, then $\beta(\left\{ \pi + \omega \right\}) = \beta(\left\{ 3\pi / 2 \right\}) = \int_{t \in \Theta \cup \Theta + \pi/2} \sin(t) \, \beta(dt) \geq 0$
- If $\omega < \pi/2$, then $\beta(\left\{ \pi + \omega \right\}) = B + v_\omega \cdot p_\omega > 0$ and $\beta(\left\{ 3 \pi/2 \right\}) = A + u_0 \cdot p_\omega \geq 0$.

Now we use the Gauss-Minkowski theorem (TODO: some theorem in Appendix A). If $\omega = \pi/2$, then there is a unique convex body $K$ up to translation so that $\beta_K$ has support in $\Pi$ and $\beta_K = \beta$ on $\Pi$. The equations on $\beta$ imply that the width of $K$ measured in the direction of $v_0$ is 1. So among all possible translations of $K$, the body that is a cap ($p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ and $p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$) is unique up to horizontal translation. If $\omega < \pi/2$, then there is a unique convex body $K$ such that $\beta_K$ has support in $\Pi$, $\beta_K = \beta$ on $\Pi$, and $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$. The equations on $\beta$ is equivalent to that $K$ has width 1 in the direction of $u_\omega$ and $v_0$. So this $K$ is a cap. □
