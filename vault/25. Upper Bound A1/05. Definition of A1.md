The main difficulty of analyzing the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}(K)$ of a cap $K$ is in the area $\left| \mathcal{N}(K) \right|$ of the niche. The niche of Gerver's sofa consists of three curves: the large arc carved out by the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{K_G}(t)$, and the two smaller convex curves with tangent lines $b_{K_G}(t)$ and $d_{K_G}(t)$ trimming out a small region at the both ends of the large arc.

Orange, blue, and yellow colors represent the points of the sofa touching the left inner wall $d_{K_G}(t)$, inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{K_G}(t)$, and right inner wall $b_{K_G}(t)$ respectively. ^fig-gerver-movement-stages

Gerver derived his sofa by assuming _a priori_ that the niche of a sofa of maximum area consists of such three curves. We circumvent the difficulty by considering only the region bounded by the path $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ of the inner corner for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, ignoring the area trimmed by $b_{K}(t)$ and $d_{K}(t)$. If the cap $K$ is well-behaved, then the area enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ can be expressed as an integral using Green's theorem. We use this integral to define $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ as the area of $K$ subtracted by the area enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. So for any well-behaved cap $K$, the value $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ becomes an upper bound of $\mathcal{A}(K)$.

We now rigorously define the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ and prove its claimed properties. First define the _curve area functional_ of an arbitrary rectifiable curve $\mathbf{x}$.

> __Definition [planar-cross-product].__ For two points $(a, b), (c, d) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, denote their cross product as $(a, b) \times (c, d) = ad - bc \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-planar-cross-product

> __Definition [curve-area-functional].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any rectifiable curve equipped with a parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of bounded variation. Write $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. Define the _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ of $\Gamma$ as the following. ^def-curve-area-functional
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t)
$$
> Also, write $\mathcal{I}(p, q)$ for the area functional of the line segment $\mathbf{x}$ connecting point $p$ to $q$. Then we have $\mathcal{I}(p, q) = 1/2 \cdot (p \times q)$.

Note that the value of $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ does not change even if we take a different parametrization of the curve $\Gamma$. Note also that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is of bounded variation, so the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d \mathbf{x}(t) = (dx(t), dy(t))$ exists and the integral is well-defined. If $\mathbf{x}$ is a Jordan curve oriented counterclockwise (resp. clockwise), by Green's theorem $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ is the exact area of the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}$ (resp. the area with a negative sign). If $\mathbf{x}$ is not closed, $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ measures the signed area of the region bounded by the line segment connecting origin and $\mathbf{x}(a)$, the curve $\mathbf{x}$, and then the line segment connecting $\mathbf{x}(b)$ and the origin in order. If $\gamma$ is the concatenation of two curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ then $\mathcal{I}(\gamma) = \mathcal{I}(\alpha) + \mathcal{I}(\beta)$; this will useful in decomposing the area enclosed by the concatenation of multiple curves.

Using the curve area functional, define the functional $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ as the following.

> __Definition [a1].__ For any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$, define $\mathcal{A}_1(K) = |K| - \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$. ^def-a1

Note that we have
$$
\mathbf{x}_K(t) = (p_K(t) - 1) u_t + (p_K(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t
$$
and $p_K$ is Lipschitz, so $\mathbf{x}_K$ is also Lipschitz and rectifiable. Thus the value $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$ is well-defined. As both $|K|$ and $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$ are quadratic functionals on $K$ by [[03. Surface Area Measure#^thm-surface-area-measure-area]], [[05. Definition of A1#^def-curve-area-functional]] and that $\mathbf{x}_K$ is convex-linear with respect to $K$, the functional $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is also quadratic with respect to $K$.

W now show that $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is an upper bound of the area functional $\mathcal{A}(K)$ assuming the injectivity hypothesis. Our key observation is the following.

> __Lemma [curve-area-functional-lower-bound].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ be arbitrary. Let $\mathbf{z} : [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be any simple open curve (that is, curve with $t_0 < t_1$ and injective $\mathbf{z}$) inside the set $F_{\pi/2} \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \pi/2} \overline{Q^-_K(t)}$ such that $\mathbf{z}(t_0)$ and $\mathbf{z}(t_1)$ are both on the line $y=0$. Then we have $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{z}) \leq |\mathcal{N}(K)|$. ^lem-curve-area-functional-lower-bound

_Proof._ First, we define the set $\mathcal{N}_0$ which is bounded from above by $\mathbf{z}$ and from below by the line $y=0$ as the following. Take an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$. Construct the closed curve $\Gamma_{\epsilon}$ which is the concatenation of the following curves in order: the curve $\mathbf{z}(t)$, the vertical segment from $\mathbf{z}(t_1)$ to  $\mathbf{z}(t_1) - (0, \epsilon)$, the horizontal segment from $\mathbf{z}(t_1) - (0, \epsilon)$ to $\mathbf{z}(t_0) - (0, \epsilon)$, and then the vertical segment from $\mathbf{z}(t_0) - (0, \epsilon)$ to $\mathbf{z}(t_0)$. The curve $\Gamma_{\epsilon}$ is a Jordan curve because $\mathbf{z}$ is a simple curve above the $x$-axis and we have $\mathbf{z}(t_0) \neq \mathbf{z}(t_1)$. By Jordan Curve Theorem, the curve $\Gamma_\epsilon$ encloses an open set $\mathcal{N}_\epsilon$. 

Define $\mathcal{N}_0$ as the intersection $F_{\pi/2} \cap \mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}$. The set is independent of the choice of $\epsilon > 0$: this can be shown rigorously by exhibiting a continuous deformation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that fixes the half-plane $y \geq 0$ and shrinks the half-plane $y \leq 0$ linearly so that it sends the line $y=-\epsilon_1$ to $y=-\epsilon_2$ for arbitrary $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2 > 0$. Moreover, $\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}$ is the disjoint union of $\mathcal{N}_0$ and the rectangle below the $x$-axis of width $\left| \mathbf{z}(t_1) - \mathbf{z}(t_0) \right|\cdot u_0$ and height $\epsilon$.

We have $\left| \mathcal{N}_\epsilon \right| = \left| \mathcal{I}(\Gamma_\epsilon) \right|$ by Green's theorem on $\Gamma_\epsilon$ (note that this holds regardless of the orientation of $\Gamma_\epsilon$). By taking $\epsilon \to 0$, we have $\left| \mathcal{N}_0 \right| = \left| \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{z}) \right|$. We now show that $\mathcal{N}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)$ which finishes the proof. Take any $p \in \mathcal{N}_0$. Take the ray $r$ emanating from $p$ in the direction $v_0$, then it should cross some point $q \neq p$ in the curve $\mathbf{z}$. As $\mathbf{z}$ is inside the set $F_{\pi/2} \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \pi/2} \overline{Q^-_K(t)}$, the point $q$ is contained in $F_{\pi/2} \cap \overline{Q_K^-(t)}$ for some $0 < t < \pi/2$ ($t \neq 0, \pi/2$ because $q$ is strictly above the line $y=0$ and $Q^-_K(t)$ is on or below the line $y=0$ if $t=0, \pi/2$). Because $p$ is in $F_{\pi/2}$ and strictly below the point $q$, it should be that $p$ is contained in $F_{\pi/2} \cap Q_K^-(t)$. So the point $p$ is in the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$, and we have $\mathcal{N}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)$. â–¡

We can freely choose $\mathbf{z}$ to bound $\left| \mathcal{N}(K) \right|$ from below as long as $\mathbf{z}$ is inside the set $F_{\pi/2} \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \pi/2} \overline{Q^-_K(t)}$. Right now, we simply choose $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x}_K$ and get the following.

> __Theorem [a1-upper-bound].__ For any well-behaved cap $K$, we have $\mathcal{A}(K) \leq \mathcal{A}_1(K)$. ^thm-a1-upper-bound

For the next upper bound $\mathcal{A}_2$, we will choose a more refined version of $\mathbf{z}$ that matches the boundary of $\mathcal{N}(K)$ more closer by including the two small areas trimmed at the end of the curve $\mathbf{x}_K$.
