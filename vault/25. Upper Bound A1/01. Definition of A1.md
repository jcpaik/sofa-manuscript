We will prove the main [[00. Sofa area functional#^pro-main-cap]] using an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}$. Here we first define $\mathcal{A}_1$. Define the _curve area functional_ on an arbitrary rectifiable curve $\mathbf{x}$.

> __Definition [planar-cross-product].__ For two points $(a, b), (c, d) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, denote their cross product as $(a, b) \times (c, d) = ad - bc \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-planar-cross-product

> __Definition [curve-area-functional].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any curve equipped with a parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of bounded variation. With $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, define the _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ of $\Gamma$ as the following. ^def-curve-area-functional
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t)
$$
> Also, write $\mathcal{I}(p, q)$ for the area functional of the line segment connecting point $p$ to $q$, so that we have $\mathcal{I}(p, q) = 1/2 \cdot (p \times q)$.

Note that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is of bounded variation, so the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d \mathbf{x}(t) = (dx(t), dy(t))$ of the coordinates $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ exists, and the integral in [[01. Definition of A1#^def-curve-area-functional]] is well-defined. Note also that the value of $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ does not change even if we take a different parametrization of the curve $\Gamma$. By Green's theorem we have the following.

> __Proposition [curve-area-functional-area].__ If $\mathbf{x}$ is a Jordan curve oriented counterclockwise (resp. clockwise), $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ is the exact area of the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}$ (resp. the area with a negative sign). ^pro-curve-area-functional-area

If $\mathbf{x}$ is not closed (that is, $\mathbf{x}(a) \neq \mathbf{x}(b)$), the sofa area functional $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ measures the signed area of the region bounded by the curve $\mathbf{x}$, and then the line segments connecting $\mathbf{x}(a)$ and $\mathbf{x}(b)$ respectiely. We also have the following additivity of $\mathcal{I}$.

> __Proposition [curve-area-functional-additive].__ If $\gamma$ is the concatenation of two curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ then $\mathcal{I}(\gamma) = \mathcal{I}(\alpha) + \mathcal{I}(\beta)$. ^pro-curve-area-functional-additive

For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ and cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$, we want the value of $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ to be essentially the area of $K$ minus the area of the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega]$. We want to express the area enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_K$ as $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$. Note that the support function $p_K$ of $K$ is Lipschitz, so
$$
\mathbf{x}_K(t) = (p_K(t) - 1) u_t + (p_K(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t
$$
is also Lipschitz. Thus the value $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$ is well-defined. With this, define the functional $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ as the following.

> __Definition [a1].__ For any angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ and cap $K$ in $\mathcal{K}_\omega$, define $\mathcal{A}_1(K) = |K| - \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_K)$. ^def-a1

We now show that $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is an upper bound of the area functional $\mathcal{A}(K)$ assuming the injectivity hypothesis. Our key observation is the following.

> __Lemma [curve-area-functional-lower-bound].__ Let $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ and $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\omega}$ be arbitrary. Let $\mathbf{z} : [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be any open simple curve (that is, a curve with $t_0 < t_1$ and injective parametrization $\mathbf{z}$) inside the set $F_{\omega} \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} \overline{Q^-_K(t)}$, such that the starting point $\mathbf{z}(t_0)$ is on the boundary $l(\pi/2, 0)$ of $F_\omega$, and the endpoint $\mathbf{z}(t_1)$ is on the boundary $l(\omega, 0)$ of $F_\omega$. Then we have $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{z}) \leq |\mathcal{N}(K)|$. ^lem-curve-area-functional-lower-bound

_Proof._ Define $\mathbf{b}$ as the curve from $\mathbf{z}(t_1)$ to $\mathbf{z}(t_0)$ along the boundary of fan $F_\omega$. Since $\mathbf{z}$ is injective, we have $\mathbf{z}(t_0) \neq \mathbf{z}(t_1)$ so $\mathbf{b}$ is also an open simple curve. For every $\epsilon > 0$, define the closed curve $\Gamma_\epsilon$ as the concatenation of the following curves in order: the curve $\mathbf{z}(t)$, the vertical segment from $\mathbf{z}(t_1)$ to  $\mathbf{z}(t_1) - (0, \epsilon)$, the curve $\mathbf{b} - (0, \epsilon)$ shifted downwards by $\epsilon$, and then the vertical segment from $\mathbf{z}(t_0) - (0, \epsilon)$ to $\mathbf{z}(t_0)$. The curve $\Gamma_{\epsilon}$ is a Jordan curve because $\mathbf{z}$ is an open simple curve inside $F_\omega$. By Jordan curve theorem, the curve $\Gamma_\epsilon$ encloses an open set $\mathcal{N}_\epsilon$. Define $\mathcal{N}_0$ as the intersection $F_{\pi/2} \cap \mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}$, then $\mathcal{N}_0$ is independent of the choice of $\epsilon > 0$ because there is a continuous deformation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that fixes $F_\omega$ and shrinks that maps . Moreover, $\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}$ is the disjoint union of $\mathcal{N}_0$ and the fixed region below the boundary of $F_\omega$ of area $\left| \mathbf{z}(t_1) - \mathbf{z}(t_0) \right| \epsilon$.

We have $\left| \mathcal{N}_\epsilon \right| = \left| \mathcal{I}(\Gamma_\epsilon) \right|$ by Green's theorem on $\Gamma_\epsilon$, and note that this holds regardless of the orientation of $\Gamma_\epsilon$. By sending $\epsilon \to 0$, we have $\left| \mathcal{N}_0 \right| = \left| \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{z}) \right|$. We now show that $\mathcal{N}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)$ which finishes the proof. Take any $p \in \mathcal{N}_0$. Take the ray $r$ emanating from $p$ in the direction $v_0$, then it should cross some point $q \neq p$ in the curve $\mathbf{z}$. As $\mathbf{z}$ is inside the set $F_{\omega} \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} \overline{Q^-_K(t)}$, the point $q$ is contained in $F_{\omega} \cap \overline{Q_K^-(t)}$ for some $0 \leq t \leq \omega$. We have $t \neq 0, \omega$ because $q$ is strictly above the line $y=0$ and $Q^-_K(t)$ is on or below the line $y=0$ if $t=0, \pi/2$). Because $p$ is in $F_{\pi/2}$ and strictly below the point $q$, it should be that $p$ is contained in $F_{\pi/2} \cap Q_K^-(t)$. So the point $p$ is in the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$, and we have $\mathcal{N}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{N}(K)$. â–¡

We can freely choose the curve $\mathbf{z}$ inside the set $F_{\pi/2} \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \pi/2} \overline{Q^-_K(t)}$. In this paper, we simply choose $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x}_K$ and get the following.

> __Theorem [a1-upper-bound].__ For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ and $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\omega}$, if the curve $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and in $F_\omega$, we have $\mathcal{A}(K) \leq \mathcal{A}_1(K)$. ^thm-a1-upper-bound
