> __Theorem [boundary-measure-cap].__ The boundary measure $\beta_K$ of $K$ on $S^1$ has support in $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$ and satisfies the followings. ^thm-boundary-measure-cap
$$
\int_{t \in \Theta} \cos(t) \, \beta_K(dt) = 1 \qquad \int_{t \in \Theta + \pi/2} \cos\left( \omega + \pi/2 - t \right)  \, \beta_K(dt) = 1
$$

_Proof._ $\beta_K$ has support in $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$ by [[yy. Monotone Sofas#^def-cap]]. We have $\left( A^+_K(\omega) - A^-_K(0) \right) \cdot v_0 = 1$ for any cap $K$, and by applying [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure]] to the formula, we obtain the first equation. The second equation can be obtained by a symmetric argument. â–¡
