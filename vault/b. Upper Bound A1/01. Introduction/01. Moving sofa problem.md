Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\mu_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that there is a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$ [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @croft2012unsolved]. Specifically, Gerver conjectured that his sofa $S_G$ _is_ the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ and thus the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Numerical experimentations support $S_{\max} = S_G$.[^numerical] Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] derived Gerver's sofa $S_G$ as a candidate of $S_{\max}$ under the following assumptions.

1. $S_{\max}$ rotates clockwise by $\pi/2$ during its movement in $L$.
2. $S_{\max}$ is symmetric along the $y$-axis.
3. The full movement of $S_{\max}$ in $L$ consists of five stages of differentiable movements, in each $S$ makes contact with a specific set of the walls and the inner corner $(0, 0)$ of $L$.

The first assumption is proved in [Baek]. However, the last assumption on $S_{\max}$ remain unproven, leaving $S_{\max} = S_G$ still open to this date. Still, the resulting sofa $S_G$ of Gerver is a valid sofa, so it gives a lower bound.

All known upper bounds of $\mu_{\max}$, including that of Kallus and Romik, approximate the moving sofa by a polygonal intersection $S_\Theta$ of the horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and copies of hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by each angle in a finite set $\Theta \subset (0, \pi/2)$ (see [[b. Upper Bound A1/01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-polygon-sofa]]).[^polygon-sofa] The bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2 \sqrt{2} = 2.828\dots$ by Hammersley [@hammersley1968enfeeblement] is obtained by taking a single angle $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/4 \right\}$, and the bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ by Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018] is achieved by taking five specific angles $\Theta$ and estimating the area of $S_\Theta$ from above with extensive computer assistance.

In this paper, we identify a property of $S_{\mathrm{\max}}$ called the _injectivity hypothesis_ that we believe what is needed for a complete resolution of the moving sofa problem. While we do not prove it completely, we reduce it to a finite computation, and show that under the assumption of Gerver's conjecture, the program terminates in a finite time and produces a proof of the injectivity hypothesis. An implementation of such program, and thus the complete resolution of the injectivity hypothesis, will be the goal of the next paper.

An important consequence of the injectivity hypothesis is a concave upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ that produces an upper bound $\mu_{\mathrm{\max}} \leq 1 + \pi^2/8$. By the notion of monotone sofas in [Baek1], the moving sofa problem becomes the optimization of the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A}$ on a convex domain $\mathcal{K}$ of convex bodies. We produce a concave upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$.

The idea for construction of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is to overestimate the area of a moving sofa $S$ by ignoring the effect of the inner walls to the moving sofa $S$ (compare the left side of [[b. Upper Bound A1/01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-presofa]] to [[b. Upper Bound A1/01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-gerver]]). The overestimated area $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ ([[b. Upper Bound A1/01. Introduction/03. Main result#^fig-a1-upper-bound]]) turns out to be a quadratic functional on a convex body $K$ that we call the _cap_ of $S$. We establish the concavity of $\mathcal{A}_1$ using Mamikon's theorem [@mnatsakanianAnnularRingsEqual1997], a theorem in classical geometry ([[b. Upper Bound A1/25. Upper Bound A1/10. Concavity of A1#^fig-mamikon-sofa]]). Then we introduce a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory to find a global optimum $K_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$. The optimum of $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives an unmovable sofa $S_1$ of area $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$ and width $\pi$ very close to the area of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ (see the right side of [[#^fig-presofa]]).

The regions below two tails (red curves) stick out of the hallway $L$ during the movement of $S_1$ in $L$ (left). The shape $S_1$ is very similar to Gerver's sofa $S_G$ whose boundary is drawn in dotted lines (right). ^fig-presofa

[^sofa-translation]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate it at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]).

[^sofa-closed]: Taking the closure of a movable set $S$ does not hurt the movability.

[^numerical]: Approximate solutions found by Gibbs [@gibbsComputationalStudySofas2014] in 2014 and Batsch [@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022] in 2022 deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.
