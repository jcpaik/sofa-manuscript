> __Definition [half-line-extension].__ For any cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ and angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, denote the infinite line extension of the half-line $b_K(t)$ (resp. $d_K(t)$) as $\overline{b}_K(t)$ (resp. $\overline{d}_K(t)$). Define $H_K^r(t)$ as the closed half-plane bounded by $\overline{b}_K(t)$ in the direction of $u_t$. Likewise, define $H_K^l(t)$ as the closed half-plane bounded by $\overline{d}_K(t)$ in the direction of $v_t$. ^def-half-line-extension

_Proof._ (1) See the left side of [[b. Upper Bound A1/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^fig-leg-computation]]; this is a picture of $L_K(t)$ in perspective of upright position. Let $z$ be the intersection of $\overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{d}_K(t)$. Let $\alpha$ be the real value such that $z + \alpha u_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. Then we have $\lambda^1(d_K(t) \cap H_K^r(t + \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$. It remains to show that $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot (g_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta / 2) - 1)$. Let $w_b$ be the intersection of $\overline{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{b}_K(t)$. Let $w_d$ be the intersection of $\overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\overline{d}_K(t)$.  □


How to use $O$ notation

A uniform polygon cap with step $\delta$ is a maximum polygon cap with uniform angle set.

We will take a uniform polygon cap with step $\delta$. Then we will take $\delta \to 0$ (effectively $n \to \infty$). Write $O_\delta(f(\delta))$ for any term that is bounded by $C f(\delta)$ for $\delta$ sufficiently close to zero.


> __Lemma [balanced-discrete-ineq].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ be any maximum polygon cap with uniform angle set $\Theta := \Theta_{\pi/2, n}$ of size $n-1$ and interval length $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$. Take any $t \in \Theta$ and three consecutive angles $t - \delta, t, t + \delta$. ^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq

_Proof._ Let $X := d_K(t) \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ be the side(s) of $\mathcal{N}(K)$ contributed by the half-line $d_K(t)$ form $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. The main idea is to bound the length $\lambda^1(X)$ of $X$ from above, and then use balancedness of $K$. Let $U := \left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\}$ and  $R := \bigcup_{u \in U} H_K^r (u)$ be the union of three half-planes. Divide $X$ into $X \cap R$ and $X \setminus R$. We bound $\lambda^1(X \cap R)$ and $\lambda^1(X \setminus R)$ separately.

We first bound $\lambda^1(X \cap R)$ from above. As $X \subseteq d_K(t)$, we have
$$
\lambda^1(X \cap R) \leq \lambda^1(d_K(t) \cap R) = \max(d_K(t) \cap H_K^r(t - \delta), d_K(t) \cap H_K^r(t + \delta))
$$
By the computation in [[b. Upper Bound A1/15. Injectivity Hypothesis/88. Right-Lipschitz h#^lem-leg-computation]], we have
$$
\lambda^1(X \cap R) \leq (\delta + O(\delta^2)) \cdot \max()
$$

- TODO: deal with topology shenanigans at below

Now we bound $\lambda^1(X \setminus R)$ from above. Define $Y := R \cup H_-(\pi/2, 0)$. Then $Y$ is disjoint from $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ and the boundary of $Y$ intersects $\overline{d}_K(t)$ at only a finite number of points. Since $X \subseteq \overline{d}_K(t)$, we have
$$
X \setminus R \subseteq d_K(t) \cap \partial (\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup Y).
$$
The set $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup Y$ now contains $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus $

Define $D_+ = \overline{d}_K(t) \cap \overline{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $D_- = \overline{d}_K(t) \cap \overline{d}_K(t - \delta)$ as the intersections of infinite extensions of $d_K(t)$ and $d_K(t \pm \delta)$. We want to ignore the fact that the half-lines $d_K(u)$ for $u \in \left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\}$ terminate at $\mathbf{x}_K(u)$, instead pretend they extend infinitely, and say that $X$ is contained in the line segment connecting $D_+$ and $D_-$. This is not true. But we turn this hope into a rigorous argument by ignoring the half-planes in which $d_K(u)$ terminate.


By xx, $\nu_{K}(t + \pi/2) = \lambda^1(X)$ is the length of $X$.

$g_K^+(t)$ is the length between $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$ and $a_K(t) \cap a_K(t + \delta)$.

$g_K^+(t) - (1 - \tan (\delta / 2))$ ignored.

$(1 + \tan (\delta / 2)) - g_K^-(t)$ ignored.

Total ignored: $\tan \delta \cdot\max(0, g_K^+(t) - 1 + \tan (\delta/2), 1 + \tan (\delta / 2) - g_K^-(t))$.

Take $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \cup H_K^r(t - \delta) \cup H_K^r (t + \delta)$. This set now contains the complements of $H_K^l(u)$. The boundary of THIS set is bounded by the segment connecting $D_+$ and $D_-$. 



We will ignore the 

We analyze how much the half-line $d_K(t)$ contributes to the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, bounding $\nu_{K_{\Theta}}(t + \pi/2)$ from above. Then by the balancedness of 

Ignore the right side of $b_K(t)$, $b_K(t \pm \delta)$ completely. This sacrifices the contribution above.

Check computations. 
$h_K^+(t) = h_K^-(t) + \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$.

$h_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^-(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^+(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) - \sec \delta \cdot \sigma$.

$\sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$ if lower bounded by $2 \tan (\delta / 2)$, then should be at most the ignored above.

Make the continuous version. $\max(1, |g_K^{\pm}(t) - 1|)$. This integrated.



Bounds $\sec \delta \geq 1$
$\tan \delta = \delta + O(\delta^3)$
$\sec \delta < \delta + O(\delta^3)$
$\delta g_K^+(t - \delta) = \int_{t - \delta}^t g_K^{\pm}(u) \, du + O(\delta^2)$
Using the estimates, we get
$h_K^+(t - \delta) \geq h_K^+(t) - O(\delta^2)$

Sum over, and $O(\delta)$ terms cannot be ignored but $O(\delta^2)$ and smaller can be ignored
(we sum $O(1/\delta)$ terms)

_Proof._ Circle chord! Observe that $\mathbf{y}_K$ on $I$ is on the circle of diameter $A_K^-(t)$ and $C_K^-(t)$. Diameter at most 4. □



Q. How does $h^{\pm}_{K_n}$ and $g_{K_n}^{\pm}$ converge to that of $K$ as $n \to \infty$?

Really hope it converges in integral. That is, integral of them on intervals converge.
Can assume closed or open; single point zeroes out always.





Definitely not pointwise. 


To prove (TODO):

$g$ at least one -> $h'$ increasing by at least g>=1, decreases by at most max(one, g - 1). Either way h' never decreases.

no condition on $g$ -> $h'$ increases by $g$, decreases by at most max(one, |g-1|). Either way h' decreases in total by at most one.

Then:

$h$ at least one on interval $[0, \pi/4]$ (compute using SofaDesigner)

symmetry. $g$ at least one on interval $[\pi/4, \pi/2]$.

$h$ exactly one on $\pi/2$. $g$ at least one. use above to conclude $h$ at least one. Monotonicity!

HMM.. let's try again.

WLOG $g$ at least one on interval $[\pi/2 - 0.1, \pi/2]$. $g(\pi/2) > 1.1$ or something like that.

So $h$ is at least one on $[\pi/2 - 0.1, \pi/2]$. 

That means $g$ is ...

We need _lower bound_ on $\sigma$ to establish any computer free proof. But this could definitely be zero in Gerver's sofa.
