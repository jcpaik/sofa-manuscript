Our goal is this.

> __Theorem [leg-right-lipschitz].__ If $h_K(t) > 1.1$ and $|g_K(t) - 1| \leq C$, then $h_K(t - \delta) \geq h_K(t) - C \delta$. 
> ^thm-leg-right-lipschitz

Proof sketch. $h_K(t) > 1.1$ ensures that $\mathbf{x}$ only moves in upward direction of $\nu_t$. $|g_K(t) - 1| \leq C$ ensures that the movement of $\mathbf{x}$ along $\mu_t$ is controlled by Lipschitz $C$. 

Need to only show this for approximate.

> __Theorem [leg-right-lipschitz-polygon].__ Assume any polygon balanced cap with three adjacent angles $t, t - \delta^-, t + \delta^+$ and $\delta = (\delta^- + \delta^+)/2$. Assume $h_K(t, t + \delta^+) \geq 1.1$ (note no assumption on $\delta^-$: this is important). Then the side length $\sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$ should be at most $\delta + O(\delta^2)$ where the constant of $O$ does not depend on $K$ (only 1.1)
> ^thm-leg-right-lipschitz-polygon

- Next step is to send this to limit $K_n \to K$ and conclude that $\sigma_K$ have density at most one.
- The division by half comes from $\tan(\delta/2)$ side length.
- Pointwise convergence seems enough to also handle condition.

_Proof._ (sketch)

Hmm...

If this works.... $h' = -\sigma + g$. I'm showing $\sigma \leq 1$ always.Doesn't this suffice for injectivity right away?????? We only need some width bound. 

No. I'm showing $\sigma \leq 1$ conditioned that $h \geq 1$.

IF $h_K \leq 1$, then clockwise rotation seems to absorb a lot of right side. So the same conclusion seem to hold.

IF $\sigma \leq 1$ can be shown unconditionally, then max $\sigma$ deplets $h$ as fast as it can. Smaller $g$ is also increasing $h$ less. 

- This won't happen - Gerver's sofa already have $\sigma > 1$ for some point

Whatever it is, bounding $\sigma$ from below controls $h$. 


- 

- Segment:

- Real question: is there any cap satisfying all conditions above while failing to be injective?


- Measure right upper derivative <= 1 ????



How to execute the full argument of right derivative of $\sigma$ at $t$ is at most $g$:

- Handle $h > 1$ and $h < 1$ separately. Don't do anything for equality case as of now. Assume good upper and lower constant bound for $g$.
- Use right continuity of $h$ to take a small interval $[t, t + \delta]$ where $h$ is under epsilon gap from $h$.



> __Lemma [calccalc].__ Take $t$ and $t+\delta$ and any cap $K$. The value $\mathbf{x}_K(t + \delta) - \mathbf{x}_K(t) = h_K(t, t + \delta) and g_K(t, t + \delta)$. If $\mathbf{x}_K$ the same, then $h_K(t, t +\delta) = 1 + \tan(\delta/2)$ and $g_K(t, t + \delta) = 1 - \tan(\delta/2)$.

$$
\begin{gather*}
\mathbf{x}_K(t + \delta) - \mathbf{x}_K(t) = - (g_K(t, t + \delta) - (1 - \tan(\delta/2))) \mu_t +  (h_K(t, t + \delta) - (1 + \tan(\delta/2))) \nu_t \\
= 
\end{gather*}
$$

Wait... I can just use right derivative!! $\mathbf{x}_K(t + \delta) - \mathbf{x}_K(t) = \delta \mathbf{x}_K'(t) + o(\delta)$. This $o$ does depend on 

- Let $K$ be a limiting maximal cap with polygonal caps approximations $K_n$.

- Polygon cap convergence $K_n \to K$. 
	- $h_{K_n}^{+1}$ is the discretized version. Well... this is just equal to $h_{K_n}^+$ for polygon cap!!
	- $h_{K_n}^+ \to h_K^+$ pointwise on $t \in \Theta$.
		- First, $h_{K_n}(t, t') \to h_{K}(t, t')$. 
	- This route of converging $h_{K_n}$ to $h_K$ uniformly sounds hard.

Instead we can appeal to just math induction.
