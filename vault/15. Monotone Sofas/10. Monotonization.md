Here, we rigorously define the notion of monotone sofas and establish [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-monotone-sofa]]. First, define the _monotonization_ of any moving sofa $S$ in standard position as the following set.

> __Definition [monotonization].__ Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. The _monotonization_ of $S$ is the intersection ^def-monotonization
$$
\mathcal{M}(S) = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_S(t).
$$

Condition 3 of [[07. Tangent hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]] implies that the set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains $S$.

> __Corollary [monotonization-is-larger].__ $\mathcal{M}(S) \supseteq S$ for any moving sofa $S$ in standard position. ^cor-monotonization-is-larger

Gerver claimed [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-monotone-sofa]] in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] that the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also a moving sofa. However, he did not show that the set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected, which is essential for $\mathcal{M}(S)$ to be a moving sofa. We fill the gap in his argument by showing that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is indeed connected.

> __Theorem [monotonization-is-connected].__ Let $S$ be a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. Then the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected. ^thm-monotonization-is-connected

Once the connectedness of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is established, we can show that monotonization enlarges any moving sofa to a larger moving sofa.

> __Proposition [monotonization-is-sofa].__ The monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position is a moving sofa with the same rotation angle $\omega$ containing $S$. ^pro-monotonization-is-sofa

_Proof._ By [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]], the shape $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected. By [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotonization]], the set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is contained $P_\omega$ and $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$, so it satisfies the second condition of [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]], so the set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is a moving sofa. □

A _monotone sofa_ is defined as 

> __Definition [monotone-sofa].__ A _monotone sofa_ is a moving sofa which is the monotonization of some moving sofa in standard position. ^def-monotone-sofa

In particular, we can always assume that a sofa of maximum area is a monotone sofa by [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^pro-monotonization-is-sofa]]. proving [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-monotone-sofa]] in the introduction. The rest of this subsection is dedicated to proving [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]].

# Proof of [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]]

We prepare the following terminologies.

> __Definition [cap-sofa].__ Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. Define the set ^def-cap-sofa
$$
\mathcal{C}(S) = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^+_S(t).
$$

> __Definition [closed-in-direction].__ Say that a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is _closed in the direction of_ vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $\lambda \geq 0$, we have $x + \lambda v \in X$. ^def-closed-in-direction

> __Definition [line-half-plane-directions].__ Any line $l$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ divides the plane into two half-planes. If $l$ is not parallel to the $y$-axis, call the _left side_ (resp. _right side_) of $l$ as the closed half-plane with boundary $l$ containing the point $- Nu_0$ (resp. $Nu_0$) for a sufficiently large $N$. If a point $p$ is on the left (resp. right) side of $l$ and not on the boundary $l$, we say that $p$ is _strictly on the left_ (resp. _right_) _side_ of $l$. ^def-line-half-plane-directions

We also prepare a lemma.

> __Lemma [cap-same-support-function].__ Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. Then the support functions $p_S$, $p_{\mathcal{M}(S)}$, and $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}$ of $S$, $\mathcal{M}(S)$ and $\mathcal{C}(S)$ agree on the set $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. ^lem-cap-same-support-function

_Proof._ We have $S \subseteq \mathcal{M}(S) \subseteq \mathcal{C}(S)$ by [[10. Monotonization#^cor-monotonization-is-larger]] and the definitions of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ and $\mathcal{C}(S)$. So it remains to show that $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}(t) \leq p_S(t)$ on every $t$ in the set $J := [0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. Define $S' = \bigcap_{t \in J} H_S(t)$, then by convexity of $S$ we have $p_{S'}(t) = p_S(t)$ on every $t \in J$. By the definition of $\mathcal{C}(S)$ we have $\mathcal{C}(S) \subseteq S'$, and so $p_{\mathcal{C}(S)}(t) \leq p_{S'}(t) = p_S(t)$ for all $t \in J$. □

An important consequence of [[10. Monotonization#^lem-cap-same-support-function]] is that a moving sofa and its cap shares the same tangent hallway.

> __Proposition [cap-same-tangent-hallway].__ For any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ of $S$ and the tangent hallway $L_K(t)$ of cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ are equal for every $t \in [0, \omega]$. ^pro-cap-same-tangent-hallway

_Proof._ The support functions of $S$ and $K$ match on $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$ by [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^lem-cap-same-support-function]]. The tangent hallways $L_X(t)$ of $X = S, K$ depend solely on the values of the support function $p_X$ of $X$ on $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$ by the equation of $L_X(t)$ in [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-tangent-hallway]]. □

We are now ready to prove that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected.

_Proof._ (of [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]]) Define the set $X = \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^-_S(t)$. By plugging the equation $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ to [[10. Monotonization#^def-monotonization]], we have $\mathcal{M}(S) = \mathcal{C}(S) \setminus X$. Observe that $\mathcal{C}(S)$ is a convex body containing $S$. Also observe that $X = \bigcup_{t \in [0, \omega]} Q^-_S(t)$ is closed in the direction of $-u_\theta$.

Fix an arbitrary point $p$ in $\mathcal{M}(S)$. Take the line $l_\theta$ passing $p$ in the direction of $u_\theta$ for an arbitrary angle $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$. The set $s_\theta = l_\theta \cap \mathcal{M}(S)$ is a nonempty line segment, because $s_\theta$ is the line segment $l_\theta \cap \mathcal{C}(S)$ minus the half-line $l_\theta \setminus X$. Now if the line $l_\theta$ meets $S$ for any $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$, then $p$ is connected to $S$ inside the line segment $s_\theta$ of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ and the proof is done. Our goal now is to prove that there is some $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ such that $l_\theta$ meets $S$.

Assume by contradiction that for every $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ the line $l_\theta$ is disjoint from $S$. By [[10. Monotonization#^lem-cap-same-support-function]] the support function of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ agrees with that of $S$ on the set $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. Because $p \in \mathcal{M}(S)$, the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is either equal to $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(0) = l_S(0)$ or strictly on the left side of $l_{S}(0)$. If $l_{\pi/2} = l_S(0)$ then $l_{\pi/2}$ contains some point of $S$, contradicting our assumption. So the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is strictly on the left side of $l_{S}(0)$, and there is a point of $S$ strictly on the right side of $l_{\pi/2}$. Likewise, as $p \in \mathcal{M}(S)$, the line $l_{\omega}$ that passes through $p$ is either equal to $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(\omega + \pi/2) = l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$ or strictly on the right side of $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$. The line $l_\omega$ cannot be equal to $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$ because we assumed that $l_\omega$ is disjoint from $S$. So the line $l_{\omega}$ is strictly on the right side of $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$, and there is a point of $S$ strictly on the left side of $l_{\omega}$.

Because the line $l_\theta$ is disjoint from $S$ for any $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$, the set $S$ is inside the set $Y = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \bigcup_{\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]} l_\theta$. Note that $Y$ has exactly two connected components $Y_L$ and $Y_R$ on the left and right side of the lines $l_\theta$ respectively. As there is a point of $S$ strictly on the right side of $l_{\pi/2}$, the set $S \cap Y_R$ is nonempty. As there is also a point of $S$ strictly on the left side of $l_\omega$, the set $S \cap Y_L$ is also nonempty. We get contradiction as $S$ should be a connected subset of $Y$. □
