The next idea of Gerver was to enlarge a moving sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega$ by intersecting the stripes $H$, $R_\omega(V)$ and the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ for each $t \in [0, \omega]$ containing $S$. The intersection then immediately satisfies the second condition of [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]]. We call this intersection as the _monotonization_ of $S$. Without loss of generality, in this paper we translate $S$ before taking the intersection so that it satisfies $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. By doing so we can assume that $S$ is contained in $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$ touching the upper edges of two stripes.

> __Definition [monotonization].__ Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ such that $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Define the _monotonization_ of $S$ as the intersection ^def-monotonization
$$
\mathcal{M}(S) = H \cap R_\omega(V) \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_S(t).
$$

> __Corollary [monotonization-contains].__ For any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega$ satisfying $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$, its monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains $S$. ^cor-monotonization-contains

Gerver claimed in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] that the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of a moving sofa $S$ is also a moving sofa because $\mathcal{M}(S)$ satisfies the second condition of [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]]. However, he did not show that the set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected which is essential for [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]] to work. We will fix his argument by proving that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is indeed connected.

> __Theorem [monotonization-is-sofa].__ Let $S$ be a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ satisfying $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Then the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ containing $S$. ^thm-monotonization-is-sofa

After proving [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]], it will be possible to call any monotonization of a moving sofa a _monotone sofa_. Because monotonizing a sofa never decreases its area, we will then be able to safely assume that a sofa $S_{\text{max}}$ of maximum area is monotone.

# Geometric Structure of Monotonization

To prove [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]], we need to first analyze the geometric structure of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ in depth. Define the following sets. 

> __Definition [parallelogram-fan].__ For any angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the _parallelogram_ $P_\omega = H \cap R_\omega(V)$ with _rotation angle_ $\omega$. If $\omega = \pi / 2$, then $P_\omega$ is the horizontal strip $H$. For any $\omega < \pi / 2$, let $p_{\omega} = l(\omega, 1) \cap l(\pi/2, 1)$ be the upper-right corner of $P_\omega$. Likewise, define the _fan_ $F_\omega = H(\pi+\omega, 0) \cap H(3\pi/2, 0)$ as the convex cone bounded by the bottom edges of $P_\omega$. ^def-parallelogram-fan

By breaking down $L_S(t)$ into $Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$, we get the following representation of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ as a subtraction of two sets. ^eqn-monotonization
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{M}(S) & = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_S(t)  \\
& =
\left( P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^+_S(t) \right) \setminus \left( F_\omega \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^-_S(t) \right)
\end{align*}
$$
The set ^eqn-cap
$$
K = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^+_S(t)
$$
is a convex set circumscribed inside the parallelogram $P_\omega$ with the outer walls $a_S(t)$ and $c_S(t)$ of $L_S(t)$ as tangent lines. Imagine $K$ as a block of clay and rotate it around the hallway $L$ while touching the outer walls $a$ and $c$. Then the inner corner of $L$ carves out the set ^eqn-niche
$$
N = F_\omega \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^-_S(t),
$$
and after the full rotation we obtain the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S) = K \setminus N$.

We now give names to sets $K$ and $N$. The set $K$ will be called as the _cap_ of $S$. We first define what a cap is.

> __Definition [cap].__ Let $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and $\Theta$ be a closed set such that $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$. A _cap_ $K$ with _rotation angle_ $\omega$ and _angle set_ $\Theta$ is a convex body such that the followings hold. ^def-cap
> 
> - $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ and $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$. Geometrically speaking, $K$ is contained in the parallelogram $P_\omega$ and touches all sides of $P_\omega$.
> - $K = \bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$ where $\Pi = \Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$. Geometrically speaking, the sides of $K$ have normal angles in $\Pi$.

Our [[07. Tangent Hallway#^def-cap]] of cap is generalized to an arbitrary set $\Theta$ of angles for future use. We also define the cap of a moving sofa $S$.

> __Proposition [cap-hallway-intersection].__ Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. By translating $S$, assume $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$ without loss of generality. Define $\mathcal{C}(S)$ as the set in [[#^eqn-cap]], then $\mathcal{C}(S)$ is a cap with the angle set $[0, \omega]$. ^pro-cap-hallway-intersection

_Proof._  □

With [[07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-cap-hallway-intersection]], we can call $\mathcal{C}(S)$ the _cap_ of $S$. The tangent hallways of a moving sofa $S$ are exactly same as the tangent hallways of its cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$.

> __Proposition [cap-same-support-function].__ Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ such that $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Let $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ be its cap. Then the support functions $p_S$ and $p_K$ of $S$ and $K$ agree on the set $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. Consequently, the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ and $L_K(t)$ of $S$ and $K$ are equal for any $t \in [0, \omega]$. ^pro-cap-same-support-function

We omit the proof of [[10. Monotonization#^pro-cap-same-support-function]]. With [[07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-cap-same-support-function]], we have $Q^-_S(t) = Q^-_K(t)$ in particular. So we can define the set $N$ [[#^eqn-niche]] purely in terms of the cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ as the following.

> __Definition [niche].__ Let $K$ be any cap with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and angle set $\Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$. Define the _niche_ of $K$ as the following. ^def-niche
$$
\mathcal{N}(K) = F_{\omega} \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_K(t)
$$

By [[10. Monotonization#^eqn-monotonization]] and the discussions so far, we have the following structure of a monotonization of a moving sofa. 

> __Theorem [monotonization-structure].__ Let $S$ be any moving with rotation angle $\omega$ satisfying $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Then the monotonization of $S$ is $\mathcal{M}(S) = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$ where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is the cap of $S$ with angle set $[0, \omega]$ and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the niche of $K$. ^thm-monotonization-structure

# Connectedness of Monotonization

We now show the connectedness of the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of a moving sofa $S$ as promised. 

_Proof._ (of [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]])

We fix the following terminology that will be used in other proofs as well.

> __Definition [closed-in-direction].__ Say that a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is _closed in the direction of_ vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $\lambda \geq 0$, we have $x + \lambda v \in X$. ^def-closed-in-direction

Fix an arbitrary point $p$ in $\mathcal{M}(S)$. Take the line $l_\theta$ passing $p$ that makes an arbitrary angle $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ with the $x$-axis. Observe that $l_\theta \cap \mathcal{M}(S)$ is a nonempty line segment because $\bigcup_{t \in [0, \omega]} Q^-_S(t)$ is closed in the direction of $-u_\theta$. So the line $l_\theta$ meets $S$ for any $\theta$, then $p$ is connected to $S$ inside $\mathcal{M}(S)$ and the proof is done. Our goal now is to prove that there is some $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ such that $l_\theta$ meets $S$. Assume by contradiction that for any $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ the line $l_\theta$ is disjoint from $S$.

As $S \subseteq \mathcal{M}(S) \subseteq \mathcal{C}(S)$ and the support function of $S$ and $\mathcal{C}(S)$ agrees on the set $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$, the support function of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ also agrees with that of $S$ on $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. As $p \in \mathcal{M}(S)$, the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is either equal to $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(0) = l_S(0)$ or strictly on the left side of $l_{S}(0)$. The line $l_{\pi/2}$ can't be equal to $l_S(0)$ because otherwise, $l_{\pi/2}$ contains some point of $S$ contradicting our assumption. So the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is strictly on the left side of $l_{S}(0)$, and there is a point of $S$ strictly on the right side of $l_{\pi/2}$.

Likewise, as $p \in \mathcal{M}(S)$, the line $l_{\omega}$ that passes through $p$ is either equal to $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(\omega + \pi/2) = l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$ or strictly on the right side of $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$. The line $l_\omega$ cannot be equal to $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$ as we assumed that $l_\omega$ is disjoint from $S$. So the line $l_{\omega}$ is strictly on the right side of $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$, and there is a point of $S$ strictly on the left side of $l_{\omega}$.

As the line $l_\theta$ is disjoint from $S$ for any $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$, the set $S$ is inside the set $X = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \bigcup_{\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]} l_\theta$. Note that $X$ has exactly two connected components $X_L$ and $X_R$ on left and right respectively. As there is a point of $S$ strictly on the right side of $l_{\pi/2}$, $S \cap X_R$ is nonempty. As there is also a point of $S$ strictly on the left side of $l_\omega$, $S \cap X_L$ is also nonempty. We get contradiction as $S$ is a connected subset of $X$. 

As the set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected, and satisfies the second condition of [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]] by definition, $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$. By [[07. Tangent Hallway#^cor-monotonization-contains]], the moving sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains $S$. We observed that the support function of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ agrees with that of $S$ on $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)$, so the cap of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is equal to the cap of $S$. □

In the proof of [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]] we showed that the support function of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is equal to that of $S$ on $[0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega]$. So we get the following corollary.

> __Corollary [monotonization-cap].__ The monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of any sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ shares the same cap with $S$. That is, $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}(S)) = \mathcal{C}(S)$. ^cor-monotonization-cap

Consequently, any monotone sofa $S$ is equal to its cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ subtracted by its niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ by [[#^thm-monotonization-structure]] and [[#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]]. In particular, the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of a monotone sofa $S$ is equal to $S$ itself and there is no gain in area by taking monotonization twice. In other words, monotonization is a _projection_ that projects any moving sofa to a monotone sofa.
