Here, we show that any monotone sofa $S$ is always equal to a _cap_ $K$ minus its _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ ([[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-structure]]). This structure will be used thoroughly in this paper. Define a _cap_ as a convex body satisfying certain properties.

> __Definition [angle-set].__ A set $\Theta$ is an _angle set_ with _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ if $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$ and $\Theta$ is closed. ^def-angle-set

> __Definition [cap].__ Let $\Theta$ be an angle set with rotation angle $\omega$. A _cap_ $K$ with _angle set_ $\Theta$ (and _rotation angle_ $\omega$) is a convex body such that the followings hold. ^def-cap
> 
> 1. $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 0$ and $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 1$.
> 2. $K$ is an intersection of half-planes with normal angles in $\Pi = \Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$.

Geometrically, the first condition of [[#^def-cap]] states that $K$ is contained in the parallelogram $P_\omega$ and touches all sides of $P_\omega$. We will show that the set $\mathcal{C}(S)$ in [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap-sofa]] is a cap with angle set $[0, \omega]$. This justifies calling $\mathcal{C}(S)$ _the cap of_ $S$. The proof is technical, so we delegate it at the end of this subsection.

> __Lemma [cap-hallway-intersection].__ The set $\mathcal{C}(S)$ in [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap-sofa]] is a cap with angle set $[0, \omega]$ as in [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap]]. With this, call $\mathcal{C}(S)$ the _cap of the moving sofa_ $S$. ^lem-cap-hallway-intersection

Define the _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ associated to any cap $K$ as the following set. Note that the fan $F_\omega$ is defined in [[05. Notations and conventions#^def-fan]].

> __Definition [niche].__ Let $K$ be any cap with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and angle set $\Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$. Define the _niche_ of $K$ as the following. ^def-niche
$$
\mathcal{N}(K) = F_{\omega} \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_K(t)
$$

Now we establish the structure of any monotonization of a sofa.

> __Theorem [monotonization-structure].__ Let $S$ be a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. The monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of $S$ is equal to $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$, where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is the cap of sofa $S$ and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the niche of the cap $K$. ^thm-monotonization-structure

To prove [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-structure]], we prepare the following corollary of [[10. Monotonization#^lem-cap-same-support-function]].

> __Corollary [cap-same-tangent-hallway].__ For any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position, the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ and $L_K(t)$ of $S$ and its cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ are equal for any $t \in [0, \omega]$. ^cor-cap-same-tangent-hallway

_Proof._ (of [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-structure]]) Fix an arbitrary moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ in a standard position. Let $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ be the cap of $S$. By breaking down each $L_S(t)$ into $Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$, the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of $S$ can be represented as the following subtraction of two sets. ^eqn-monotonization
$$
\begin{split}
\mathcal{M}(S) & = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_S(t) \\
& = \left( P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^+_S(t) \right) \setminus \left( F_\omega \cap \bigcup_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} Q^-_S(t) \right) \\
& = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)
\end{split}
$$
By [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^cor-cap-same-tangent-hallway]] we have $Q_S^-(t) = Q_K^-(t)$. □

> __Remark [cap-niche-intuition].__ The equation [[10. Monotonization#^eqn-monotonization]] can understood intuitively as the following (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). The set $K$ is a convex body bounded from below by the boundary of fan $F_\omega$, and bounded from above by the outer walls $a_S(t)$ and $c_S(t)$ of $L_S(t)$. Imagine the set $K$ as a block of clay that rotates inside the hallway $L$ in the clockwise angle of $t \in [0, \omega]$ while always touching the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of $L$. As $K$ rotates inside $L$, the inner corner of $L$ carves out the set $N$ which is the regions bounded by inner walls $b_S(t)$ and $d_S(t)$ of $L_S(t)$ from $K$. After the full movement of $K$, the final clay $K \setminus N$ is a moving sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$. ^rem-cap-niche-intuition

For the rest of the paper, we will always use the following variant [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotone-sofa-structure]] of [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-structure]] to represent any monotone sofa $S$. Note that this variant does not mention anything about monotonization.

> __Theorem [monotone-sofa-structure].__ Let $S$ be any monotone sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Then $S$ is in standard position and $S = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$, where $K := \mathcal{C}(S)$ is the cap of $S$ with angle set $[0, \omega]$, and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the niche of the cap $K$. ^thm-monotone-sofa-structure

We prepare another corollary of [[10. Monotonization#^lem-cap-same-support-function]].

> __Corollary [monotonization-cap].__ The monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position shares the same cap with $S$. That is, $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}(S)) = \mathcal{C}(S)$. ^cor-monotonization-cap

Let $S = \mathcal{M}(S')$ be any monotone sofa which is the monotonization of a moving sofa $S'$ in standard position. Then $K := \mathcal{C}(S) = \mathcal{C}(S')$ by [[10. Monotonization#^cor-monotonization-cap]]. Now apply [[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-structure]] to $\mathcal{M}(S')$ to conclude that $S = \mathcal{M}(S') = \mathcal{C}(S') \setminus \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{C}(S')) = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$.

> __Remark [monotonization-projection].__ Monotization $S \mapsto \mathcal{M}(S)$ of a moving sofa can be said as a 'projection' to monotone sofas in the sense that $\mathcal{M}$ is a surjective idempotent map that fixes monotone sofas. ^rem-monotonization-projection

# Proof of [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^lem-cap-hallway-intersection]]

We end this subsection by proving [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^lem-cap-hallway-intersection]] as promised. Define the following subset of $P_\omega$.

> __Definition [middle-set].__ For every $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define $M_\omega$ as the convex hull of the points $O, -u_\omega, -v_0,$ and $o_\omega$. ^def-middle-set

Geometrically, $M_\omega$ is a subset of $P_\omega$ enclosed by the perpendicular legs from $O$ to the bottom sides of $P_\omega$. We also introduce the following terminologies.

> __Definition [further-in-direction].__ Say that a point $p_1$ is _further than_ (resp. _strictly further than_) the point $p_2$ _in the direction_ of vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ if $p_1 \cdot v \geq p_2 \cdot v$ (resp. $p_1 \cdot v > p_2 \cdot v$). ^def-further-in-direction

We show the following lemma.

> __Lemma [cap-contains-middle-set].__ The set $\mathcal{C}(S)$ in [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap-sofa]] contains $M_\omega$. ^lem-cap-contains-middle-set

_Proof._ From $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 0$, we can take points $q$ and $r$ of $S$ so that $q$ is on the line $l(\pi/2, 0)$ further than $O = (0, 0)$ in the direction of $-u_0$, and $r$ is on the line $l(\omega, 0)$ further than $O$ in the direction of $-v_\omega$. Take an arbitrary $t \in [0, \omega]$. Because $Q^+_S(t)$ is a right-angled convex cone with normal vectors $u_t$ and $v_t$ containing $q$ and $r$, $Q_S^+(t)$ also contains $O$. Because $Q_S^+(t)$ contains $O$ and is closed in the direction of $-u_t$ and $-v_t$, $Q_S^+(t)$ contains $M_\omega$ as a subset. □

We finish the proof of [[#^lem-cap-hallway-intersection]].

_Proof._ (of [[#^lem-cap-hallway-intersection]]) Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. Let $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$. That $S \subseteq K$ is an immediate consequence of [[07. Tangent hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]]. We now show that $K$ is a cap with angle set $[0, \omega]$. By [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap-sofa]] and [[10. Monotonization#^lem-cap-contains-middle-set]] we have $M_\omega \subseteq K \subseteq P_\omega$. So the first condition of [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap]] is satisfied. The second condition of [[10. Monotonization#^def-cap]] comes from that $P_\omega$ is the intersection of four half-planes with normal angles $\omega, \pi/2, \pi + \omega, 3\pi/2$, and $Q_S^+(t)$ is an intersection of two half-planes with normal angles $t$ and $\pi/2 + t$. □
