In [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], Gerver constructed a subset $\mathcal{T}$ of sofas and showed that a sofa of maximum area exists in $\mathcal{T}$. In this section, we rephrase his ideas and define our version of the compact subset $\mathcal{T}$ containing a maximum sofa. We will call an element of $\mathcal{T}$ as a _monotone sofa_. 

The main idea of Gerver was to see a moving sofa as an intersection of rotating hallways. Consider any moving sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. Then for any angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, there is a moment where the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by an angle of $t$ and contained in $L$. Looking at this in perspective of the sofa, $S$ is contained in some translation of $L$ rotated _counterclockwise_ by arbitrary $t \in [0, \omega]$. Likewise, by looking at the initial and final position of $S$ in perspective of $S$, it is contained in both a translation of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$. Summarizing, $S$ is a _hallway intersection_ with angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$ which we define as below.

> __Definition [hallway-intersection].__ Let $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and $\Theta$ be a closed set such that $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$. Call a connected shape $S$ a _hallway intersection_ with _rotation angle_ $\omega$ and _angle set_ $\Theta$ if the followings hold.

> - $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$.
> - For every $t \in \Theta$, $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$, the hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$.

We generalized [[01. Monotone Sofa#^def-hallway-intersection]] to an arbitrary set $\Theta$ of angles for future use. Gerver essentially showed that [[01. Monotone Sofa#^def-hallway-intersection]] with angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$ is equivalent to $S$ being a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$. That is, any hallway intersection $S$ with angle set $[0, \omega]$ admits a continuous sofa movement. Take the hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t \in [0, \omega]$ containing $S$. His idea was to push the hallway towards $S$ until its outer walls touch $S$.

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ be the unique translation of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$ that touches $S$ in the outer walls. ^def-tangent-hallway

The pushed hallway also contains $S$. We omit the proof.

> __Proposition [tangent-hallway].__ For any hallway intersection $S$ with angle set $\Theta$, and for any $t \in \Theta$, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ contains $S$. ^pro-tangent-hallway

Note that [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-tangent-hallway]] holds because the hallway is rotated exactly $90^\circ$. If the angle of hallway was less than $90^\circ$, then [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-tangent-hallway]] fails. We are now ready to show the following.

> __Proposition [sofa-iff-hallway-intersection].__ A shape $S$ is a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi / 2]$ if and only if $S$ is a hallway intersection with angle set $[0, \omega]$. ^pro-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection

_Proof._ The position of $L_S(t)$ depends only on the values $p_S(t)$ and $p_S(t + \pi / 2)$ of the support function $p_S$ of $S$. As $p_S$ is continuous, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ moves continuously with respect to $t \in [0, \omega]$. Let $f_t$ be the rigid transformation that sends $L_S(t)$ to $L$. Then as $f_t$ is continuous with respect to $t$, the transformation $f_t(S)$ of $S$ moves continuously with respect to $t$, and is inside $L$ by [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-tangent-hallway]]. Because $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$, the width of $S$ measured in the direction of $v_0$ is at most 1. So $S$ is contained in the horizontal side of $L_S(0)$, and by mapping it under $f_0$ we have $f_0(S) \subseteq L_H$. Likewise, $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_\omega(V)$, so the width of $S$ measured in the direction of $v_\omega$ is at most 1. Thus $S$ is contained in the vertical side of $L_S(\omega)$, and by mapping it under $f_\omega$ we have $f_\omega(S) \subseteq L_V$. □

With [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-tangent-hallway]] and [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]], Gerver enlarged a moving sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega$ by intersecting the stripes $H$, $R_\omega(V)$ and the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ for $t \in [0, \omega]$. We call such intersection as the _monotonization_ of $S$. In this paper, we translate $S$ before taking the intersection without loss of generality so that it satisfies $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$.

> __Definition [monotonization].__ Let $S$ be any hallway intersection with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\Theta$ such that $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Define the _monotonization_ of $S$ as the intersection ^def-monotonization
$$
\mathcal{M}(S) = H \cap R_\theta(V) \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_S(t).
$$

> __Corollary [monotonization-contains].__ For any hallway intersection $S$, its monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains $S$. ^cor-monotonization-contains

We will later show that the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of a hallway intersection $S$ is always connected, so is itself a hallway intersection. We remark that in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], Gerver missed showing the connectedness of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ which is required for his argument to work rigorously. To prove the connectedness of $\mathcal{M}(S)$, we first study the geometric structure of $\mathcal{M}(S)$. We start by naming the parts of the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$.

> __Definition [rotating-hallway-parts].__ Let $Q^+ = (-\infty, 1]^2$ be the closed quarter-plane bounded by outer walls $a$ and $c$. Let $Q^- = (-\infty, 0)^2$ be the open quarter-plane bounded by inner walls $b$ and $d$, so that $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$. For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let $a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t), d_S(t), \mathbf{x}_S(t), \mathbf{y}_S(t)$ be the parts of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the parts $a, b, c, d, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, Q^+, Q^-$ of $L$ respectively. ^def-rotating-hallway-parts

So we have $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ in particular. We also define the followings.

> __Definition [parallelogram-fan].__ For any angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the _parallelogram_ $P_\omega = H \cap R_\omega(V)$ with rotation angle $\omega$. If $\omega = \pi / 2$, then $P_\omega$ is the horizontal strip $H$. For any $\omega < \pi / 2$, let $p_{\omega} = l(\omega, 1) \cap l(\pi/2, 1)$ be the upper-right corner of $P_\omega$. Likewise, define the _fan_ $F_\omega = H(0, \pi+\omega) \cap H(0, 3\pi/2)$ as the convex cone bounded by the bottom edges of $P_\omega$. ^def-parallelogram-fan

By decomposition $L_S(t)$ into $Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$, we get the following representation of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ as the subtraction of two sets.
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{M}(S) & = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_S(t)  \\
& =
\left( P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t) \right) \setminus \left( F_\omega \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_S(t) \right)
\end{align*}
$$
The set $K = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t)$ is the convex set inside the parallelogram $P_\omega$ with the outer walls $a_S(t)$ and $c_S(t)$ as tangent lines. Imagine $K$ as a block of clay and rotate it around the hallway $L$ while touching the outer walls $a$ and $c$. Then the set $N = F_\omega \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_S(t)$ is the region carved out from $L$ by the inner corner of $L_S(t)$. As we carve out the part $N$ while rotating $K$ around, we obtain the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S) = K \setminus N$. We now give names to $K$ and $N$: first, $K$ is called the _cap_ of $S$ ([[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-cap-hallway-intersection]]).

> __Definition [cap].__ A _cap_ $K$ with _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and a closed _angle set_ $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq \left[ 0, \omega \right]$ is a convex body such that the followings hold. ^def-cap
> 
> - $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ and $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$. Geometrically, $K$ is contained in the parallelogram $P_\omega$ and touches all sides of $P_\omega$.
> - $K$ has angular support in the set $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$.

> __Proposition [cap-hallway-intersection].__ Let $S$ be any hallway intersection with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and angle set $\Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$. Assume without loss of generality that $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Define $\mathcal{C}(S)$ as the following set.
$$
\mathcal{C}(S) = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} Q^+_S(t)
$$
> Then $\mathcal{C}(S)$ adheres to [[01. Monotone Sofa#^def-cap]]. With this, call $\mathcal{C}(S)$ the _cap_ of $S$. ^pro-cap-hallway-intersection

We omit the proof of [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-cap-hallway-intersection]] but note that it solely depends on the condition $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. The tangent hallways of $S$ are completely determined by its cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ as the following.

> __Proposition [cap-same-support-function].__ Let $S$ be any hallway intersection with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and angle set $\Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$ such that $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Let $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ be its cap. Then the support functions $p_S$ and $p_K$ have the same value on the set $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)$. Consequently, the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ and $L_K(t)$ of $S$ and $K$ agree on any $t \in \Theta$. That is, $?_S(t) = ?_K(t)$ for any $? = a, b, c, d, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, Q^+, Q^-$ of $L$. ^pro-cap-same-support-function

With [[01. Monotone Sofa#^pro-cap-same-support-function]], we can define the set $N = F_\omega \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_S(t) = F_\omega$ purely in terms of the cap $K$. Call $N$ the _niche_ of cap $K$.

> __Definition [niche].__ Let $K$ be any cap with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and angle set $\Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$. Define the _wedge_ $T_K(t) = F_\omega \cap Q_K^-(t)$ of $K$ for any angle $t \in \Theta$. Define the _niche_ of $K$ as the union of all wedges as the following. ^def-niche
$$
\mathcal{N}(K) = F_{\omega} \cap \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_K(t) = \bigcup_{t \in \Theta} T_K(t) 
$$

We now have the following conclusion from the discussion so far.

> __Corollary [monotonization-eq].__ Let $S$ is any hallway intersection with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\Theta$. Assume $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Then the monotonization of the hallway intersection $S$ is $\mathcal{M}(S) = K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$ where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is the cap of $S$ and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the niche of $K$. ^cor-monotonization-eq

We are now ready to show the connectedness of the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of a hallway intersection $S$.

> __Theorem [monotonization-is-hallway-intersection].__ Let $S$ be a hallway intersection with rotation angle $\omega$ and angle set $\Theta$ satisfying $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. Then the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected, and so a hallway intersection with the angle set $\Theta$. ^thm-monotonization-is-hallway-intersection

_Proof._ Take any point $p$ in $\mathcal{M}(S)$. Take the line $l_\theta$ passing $p$ that makes an angle of arbitrary $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ with the $x$-axis. Observe that $l_\theta \cap \mathcal{M}(S)$ is a nonempty line segment because $\bigcup_{t \in \Theta} Q^-_S(t)$ is closed in the direction of $-u_\theta$. So if any of $l_\theta$ meets $S$, then $p$ is connected to $S$ inside $\mathcal{M}(S)$ and the proof is done. Our goal now is to prove that there is some $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ such that $l_\theta$ meets $S$. Assume by contradiction that for any $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$ the line $l_\theta$ is disjoint from $S$.

As $S \subseteq \mathcal{M}(S) \subseteq \mathcal{C}(S)$ ([[02. Monotone Sofas#^cor-monotonization-contains]]) and the support function of $S$ and $\mathcal{C}(S)$ agrees on the set $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)$ ([[02. Monotone Sofas#^lem-cap-same-support-function]]), the support function of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ also agrees with that of $S$ on $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2)$.

As $p \in \mathcal{M}(S)$, the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is either equal to $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(0)$ or strictly on the left side of $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)(0)}$. As $p_S(0) = p_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(0)$ we have $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(0) = l_S(0)$. Now the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is either equal to $l_S(0)$ or strictly on the left side of $l_{S}(0)$. If they are equal, then $l_{\pi/2}$ contains some point of $S$ and this contradicts our assumption. So the line $l_{\pi/2}$ is strictly on the left side of $l_{S}(0)$. So there is a point of $S$ strictly on the right side of $l_{\pi/2}$.

As $p \in \mathcal{M}(S)$, the line $l_{\omega}$ that passes through $p$ is either equal to $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(\omega + \pi/2)$ or strictly on the right side of $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(\omega + \pi/2)$. As $p_S(\omega + \pi/2) = p_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(\omega + \pi/2)$ we have $l_{\mathcal{M}(S)}(\omega + \pi/2) = l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$. Now the line $l_{\omega}$ is either equal to $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$ or strictly on the right side of $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$. If they are equal, then $l_{\omega}$ contains some point of $S$ and this contradicts our assumption. So the line $l_{\omega}$ is strictly on the right side of $l_S(\omega + \pi/2)$. So there is a point of $S$ strictly on the left side of $l_{\omega}$.

As the line $l_\theta$ is disjoint from $S$ for any $\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]$, $S$ is inside the set $X = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \bigcup_{\theta \in [\omega, \pi/2]} l_\theta$. Note that the set $X$ has exactly two connected components $X_L$ and $X_R$ each in left and right respectively. As there is a point of $S$ strictly on the right side of $l_{\pi/2}$, $S \cap X_R$ is nonempty. As there is also a point of $S$ strictly on the left side of $l_\omega$, $S \cap X_L$ is nonempty. We get contradiction as $S$ is connected and a subset of $X$. □
