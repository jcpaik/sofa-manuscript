In this section, we rigorously define monotone sofas ([[10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]) and establish [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-monotone-sofa]] by filling out a logical gap ([[10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]]) of Gerver's proof in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. Moreover, we show that any monotone sofa $S$ is equal to $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$ in [[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-structure]], where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is some convex set called the _cap of_ $S$ ([[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-cap-hallway-intersection]]), and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a subset of $K$ called the _niche_ ([[12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^def-niche]]) determined by the cap $K$ (see [[01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]).
