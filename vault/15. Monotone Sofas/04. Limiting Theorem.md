> __Definition [hallway-restriction].__ Let $\Theta'$ and $\Theta$ be angle sets with rotation angle $\omega$ such that $\Theta' \subseteq \Theta$. For any cap $K$ of angle set $\Theta$, define $K|_{\Theta'} = P_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in\Theta'} Q_K^+(t)$ as the cap of angle set $\Theta'$. ^def-hallway-restriction

Then we have $\mathcal{M}(K) \subseteq \mathcal{M}(K|_{\Theta'})$ in particular.

> __Theorem [maximum-balanced-sofa].__ Let $\Theta_1 \subseteq \Theta_2 \subseteq \Theta_3 \subseteq \dots$  be any sequence of finite angle sets of rotation angle $\omega$ such that $\bigcup_{i} \Theta_i$ is dense in $[0, \omega]$. Let $S_i$ be a monotone hallway intersection with angle set $\Theta_i$ attaining the maximum area. Then there is a subsequence $\Theta_{n_j}$ so that $S$ is the limiting shape of $S_{n_j}$ with $p_{S_{n_j}} \to p_{S}$ uniformly on the interval $[0, \omega]$. ^thm-maximum-balanced-sofa

_Proof._ $\bigcup_{i} \Theta_i$ is countably infinite. A diagonal argument proves that there is a strictly increasing sequence $n_1, n_2, \dots$ of natural numbers so that $p_{S_{n_j}} \to p_S$ as $j \to \infty$. Also note that for sufficiently large $i$, the support function of $S_i$ is $C$-Lipschitz. Invoking Blaschke selection theorem, we also can assume that $K_{n_j} \to K$ for a convex set $K$. So it happens that $p_S$ is the support function of $K$.  □

Gerver fails to show that each $S_{n_j}$ is balanced: that maximum hallway intersection has to be connected. We show this using the help of `SofaDesigner` later. 

> __Theorem [sofa-bounded].__ A hallway intersection containing the angle $\pi/4$ has diameter $\leq 2 + 2 \sqrt{2} = 4.828\dots$.  Consequently, $p_S$ is $(2 + 2 \sqrt{2})$-Lipschitz.  ^thm-sofa-bounded

_Proof._ [[01. Convex Bodies#^thm-vertex-formula]] □




We bound $g_K^{\pm}(t)$ with finite values. 

Our goal here is to show that, if there is a sufficiently many angle (about 7) in the hallway intersection, then the monotone hallway intersection should be a balanced polygon. We do this because it can be possible that a perturbation of monotone hallway intersection may not be connected. The main theorem here guarantee that a perturbation is still connected, so is a monotone hallway intersection.

> __Lemma [edge-in-triangle].__ Let $K$ be any cap with angle set $\Theta$. Let $t_1 < t_2 < t_3 < t_4$ be four triangles in $\Theta$. Then for any $t \in [t_2, t_3]$, the edge $e_K(t)$ is inside the triangle with vertices $v_K(t_1, t_2)$, $v_K(t_2, t_3)$ and $v_K(t_3, t_4)$. ^lem-edge-in-triangle

In this section, fix the following parameters of angles.

I tried showing that the $y$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}(45^\circ)$ is strictly less than 1, so that $\mathbf{x}(45^{\circ})$ is strictly inside $K$. But even with five or six angles, the upper bound I get is greater than 1 -- it doesn't work.

A way to circumvent this is to not show that corners are strictly inside $K$, and you take maximum area for $K$ (where corners may go outside $K$) not hallway intersection (where corners are inside $K$). Still one can seem to show balancedness when corners could be out.
