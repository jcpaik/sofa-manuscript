Gerver's main insight for deriving his sofa $S_G$ was that a moving sofa is essentially a connected common subset of rotating hallways. Let $S$ be a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$. By looking at the movement of $S$ inside the hallway $L$ in the perspective of $S$, Gerver observed that the fixed $S$ should be contained inside the hallways rotating around $S$ (line xx-yy of [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]). Furthermore, he actually showed that for a connected shape $S$, being a common subset of rotating hallways is also _sufficient_ for $S$ to be a moving sofa (line xx-yy of [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]). We clearly state this observation of Gerver as a separate [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]].

Gerver's idea for proving [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]] was to use the hallways that touch the shape $S$ in the outer walls. We call such hallway the _tangent hallway_ of $S$.

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ be the unique translation of $R_t(L)$ that touches $S$ in the outer walls (the walls corresponding to the outer walls $(-\infty, 1] \times \left\{ 1 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 1 \right\} \times (-\infty, 1]$ of $L$). ^def-tangent-hallway

Assume that a shape $S$ is contained in a translation $L'$ of $R_t(L)$, so that $L'$ is a hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$. Then we can push $L'$ towards $S$ in the directions $-u_t$ and $-v_t$ until the outer walls of new $L' = L_S(t)$ touch $S$. The pushed hallway $L_S(t)$ still contains $S$ because the directions $-u_t$ and $-v_t$ push the inner walls of $L'$ forward or keep them stationary. Summarizing, we get the following.

> __Proposition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ contained in a translation of the hallway $R_t(L)$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t \in S^1$, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ with angle $t$ contains $S$. ^pro-tangent-hallway

Using tangent hallways, we give a complete proof of [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]] for clarity as both Gerver's statement and proof of [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]] is hidden in between the lines of the proof of Theorem 1 in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]].

_Proof._ (of [[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]])

($\Rightarrow$) Consider the movement of $S$ inside the hallway $L$. For any angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, there is a moment where the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by an angle of $t$ and contained in $L$. Looking at this in perspective of the sofa, $S$ is contained in some translation of $L$ rotated _counterclockwise_ by arbitrary $t \in [0, \omega]$. Likewise, by looking at the initial (resp. final) position of $S$ inside $L_H$ (resp. $L_V$) in perspective of $S$, the set $S$ is contained in both a translation of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$.

($\Leftarrow$) The position of the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ depends only on the values $p_S(t)$ and $p_S(t + \pi / 2)$ of the support function $p_S$ of $S$. As $p_S$ is continuous, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ moves continuously with respect to $t \in [0, \omega]$. Let $f_t$ be the rigid transformation that sends $L_S(t)$ to $L$. Then the transformation $f_t(S)$ of $S$ moves continuously with respect to $t$, and is inside $L$ by [[07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway]]. Because $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$, the width of $S$ measured in the direction of $v_0$ is at most 1. So $S$ is contained in the horizontal side of $L_S(0)$, and by mapping it under $f_0$ we have $f_0(S) \subseteq L_H$. Likewise, $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_\omega(V)$, so the width of $S$ measured in the direction of $v_\omega$ is at most 1. Thus $S$ is contained in the vertical side of $L_S(\omega)$, and by mapping it under $f_\omega$ we have $f_\omega(S) \subseteq L_V$. â–¡

Like Gerver did in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], we will also use the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ as the hallways containing our sofa $S$. So we give names to the parts of $L_S(t)$ that will be used thoroughly. We first name the parts of the hallway $L$.

> __Definition [hallway-parts].__ Let $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ be the inner and outer corner of $L$ respectively.
> 
> Let $a$ and $b$ be the lines $x=1$ and $y=1$ representing the outer walls of $L$ passing through $\mathbf{y}$. Let $c$ and $d$ be the half-lines $(-\infty, 0] \times \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0 \right\} \times (-\infty, 0]$ representing the inner walls of $L$ emanating from the inner corner $\mathbf{x}$.
> 
> Let $Q^+ = (-\infty, 1]^2$ be the closed quarter-plane bounded by outer walls $a$ and $c$. Let $Q^- = (-\infty, 0)^2$ be the open quarter-plane bounded by inner walls $b$ and $d$, so that $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$. ^def-hallway-parts

> __Figure [hallway-detailed].__ The standard hallway $L$ and its parts. ^fig-hallway-detailed

Then we name the parts of tangent hallway $L_S(t)$.

> __Definition [rotating-hallway-parts].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let $\mathbf{x}_S(t), \mathbf{y}_S(t), a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t), d_S(t), Q^+_S(t), Q^-_S(t)$ be the parts of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the parts $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, a, b, c, d, Q^+, Q^-$ of $L$ respectively. ^def-rotating-hallway-parts

So we have $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ and $Q^+_S(t) = H_S(t) \cap H_S(t + \pi/2)$ in particular. Also we have the followings.
$$
\begin{gather}
\mathbf{x}_S(t) = (p_K(t) - 1) u_t + (p_K(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t \\
\mathbf{y}_S(t) = p_K(t) u_t + p_K(t + \pi/2) v_t \\
a_S(t) = l_S(t) = l(t, p_K(t)) \\
b_S(t) = l(t, p_K(t) - 1) \\
c_S(t) = l_S(t + \pi/2) = l(t + \pi/2, p_K(t + \pi/2)) \\
d_S(t) = l(t + \pi/2, p_K(t + \pi/2) - 1)
\end{gather}
