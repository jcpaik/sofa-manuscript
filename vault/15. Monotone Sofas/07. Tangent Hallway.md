# Tangent hallway

We start by defining the _tangent hallways_ for a general shape $S$ (that is, any nonempty compact subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ by [[05. Notations and conventions#^def-shape]]).

> __Definition [rotation-map].__ Define $R_\theta : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the rotation map of $\mathbb{R}^2$ along the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $\theta \in S^1$. ^def-rotation-map

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ as the following. ^def-tangent-hallway
$$
L_S(t) = R_t(L) + (p_S(t) - 1)  u_t + (p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t
$$

The equation of $L_S(t)$ in [[07. Tangent hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway]] is motivated by the following defining property of $L_S(t)$.

> __Proposition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ is the unique rigid transformation of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$, such that the outer walls of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of $L$ are the tangent lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi/2)$ of $S$ respectively. ^pro-tangent-hallway

_Proof._ Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be arbitrary real values. Then $L' = R_t(L) + c_1 u_t + c_2 v_t$ is an arbitrary rigid transformation of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$. The outer walls of $L'$ corresponding to the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of $L$ ([[01. Introduction/05. Notations and Conventions#^def-hallway-walls]]) are then $l(t, c_1 + 1)$ and $l(t + \pi/2, c_2 + 1)$ respectively. They match with $l_S(t) = l(t, p_S(t))$ and $l_S(t + \pi/2) = l(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2))$ if and only if $c_1 = p_S(t) - 1$ and $c_2 = p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1$. That is, if and only if $L' = L_S(t)$. □

Name the parts of tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ according to the parts of $L$ ([[05. Notations and conventions#^def-hallway-corners]], [[05. Notations and conventions#^def-hallway-walls]], and [[05. Notations and conventions#^def-hallway-regions]]) for future use.

> __Definition [tangent-hallway-map].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the rigid transformation $f_{S, t} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as ^def-tangent-hallway-map
$$
f_{S, t}(z) = R_t(z) + (p_S(t) - 1)  u_t + (p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t
$$
> so that $f_{S, t}$ maps $L$ to $L_S(t)$.

> __Definition [rotating-hallway-parts].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let $\mathbf{x}_S(t), \mathbf{y}_S(t), a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t), d_S(t), Q^+_S(t), Q^-_S(t)$ be the parts of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the parts $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, a, b, c, d, Q^+, Q^-$ of $L$ respectively. That is, for any $? = \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, a, b, c, d, Q^+, Q^-$, let $?_S(t) := f_{S, t}(?)$. ^def-rotating-hallway-parts

> __Proposition [rotating-hallway-parts].__ We have $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ and $Q^+_S(t) = H_S(t) \cap H_S(t + \pi/2)$. Also we have the following representations of the parts purely in terms of the supporting function $p_S$ of $S$. ^pro-rotating-hallway-parts
$$
\begin{gather*}
\mathbf{x}_S(t) = (p_S(t) - 1) u_t + (p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t \\
\mathbf{y}_S(t) = p_S(t) u_t + p_S(t + \pi/2) v_t \\
a_S(t) = l_S(t) = l(t, p_S(t)) \\
b_S(t) \subseteq l(t, p_S(t) - 1) \\
c_S(t) = l_S(t + \pi/2) = l(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2)) \\
d_S(t) \subseteq l(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1)
\end{gather*}
$$

_Proof._ The equality $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ follows from mapping $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$ under $f_{S, t}$. The equality $Q^+_S(t) = H_S(t) \cap H_S(t + \pi/2)$ follows from [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway]] which states that the outer walls of $L_S(t)$ (and thus of $Q_S^+(t)$) are the tangent lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi/2)$. The formulas for $a_S(t)$ and $c_S(t)$ comes from [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway]]. The formulas for $b_S(t)$ and $d_S(t)$ comes from that the lines are respectively of distance 1 away from $a_S(t)$ and $c_S(t)$. The formulas for $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ and $\mathbf{y}_S(t)$ are obtained by reading the coordinates of $\mathbf{x}_S(t) = a_S(t) \cap c_S(t)$ and $\mathbf{y}_S(t) = b_S(t) \cap d_S(t)$ with respect to the orthogonal unit vectors $u_t$ and $v_t$. □

# Moving Hallway Problem

We defined a moving sofa $S$ so that any translation of $S$ is also a moving sofa ([[01. Introduction/05. Notations and Conventions#^def-sofa]]). From now on, we will always position $S$ according to the following [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-standard-position-shape]] and [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-standard-position]].

> __Proposition [standard-position-shape].__ For any angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ and shape $S$, there is a translation $S'$ of $S$ such that $p_{S'}(\omega) = p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$ which is (i) unique if $\omega < \pi/2$, or (ii) unique up to horizontal translations if $\omega = \pi/2$. ^pro-standard-position-shape

_Proof._ Since the support function $p_{S'}(t)$ measures the signed distance from origin to tangent line $l_{S'}(t)$ (see above [[01. Introduction/05. Notations and Conventions#^def-support-function]]), the translation $S'$ of $S$ satisfies the condition $p_{S'}(\omega) = p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$ if and only if $S'$ is below the lines $l(\omega, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$ and the lines are tangent to $S'$. Translate $S$ below the lines $l(\omega, 1)$ and $l(\pi/2, 1)$ so that it makes contact with the two lines. If $\omega < \pi/2$, then the constraints determine the unique location of $S'$. If $\omega = \pi/2$, then the two lines are equal to the horizontal line $y=1$, and $S'$ can move freely horizontally as long as the line $y=1$ makes contact with $S'$ from above. □

> __Definition [standard-position].__ A moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ is in _standard position_ if $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$. ^def-standard-position

So by [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-standard-position-shape]] any moving sofa can be put in standard position by translating it.

Assume any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Gerver observed in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] that $S$ should be contained in the tangent hallways $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$ by using the following proposition.

> __Proposition [tangent-hallway-contains].__ For any shape $S$ contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$ with an angle $t \in S^1$, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ with angle $t$ contains $S$. ^pro-tangent-hallway-contains

_Proof._ Assume that an arbitrary shape $S$ is contained in a translation $L'$ of $R_t(L)$ for some angle $t$. Then while keeping $S$ inside $L'$, we can push $L'$ towards $S$ in the directions $-u_t$ and $-v_t$ until the outer walls of the final $L' = L_S(t)$ make contact with $S$. The pushed hallway $L_S(t)$ still contains $S$ because the directions $-u_t$ and $-v_t$ of movement only push the inner walls of $L'$ away from $S$. □

We summarize the full details of Gerver's observation (line 18-22, p269; line 24-31, p270 of [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]) as [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]].

> __Definition [strip].__ Define the unit-width horizontal and vertical strips $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ respectively. ^def-strip

> __Definition [parallelogram].__ For any angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define the _parallelogram_ $P_\omega = H \cap R_\omega(V)$ with _rotation angle_ $\omega$. ^def-parallelogram

> __Theorem [moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection].__ Let $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ be an arbitrary angle. For a connected shape $S$, the followings are equivalent. ^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection
> 
> 1. $S$ is a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$.
> 2. $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$. Also, for every $t \in [0, \omega]$, $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$, the hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$.
> 3. Let $S'$ be any translation of $S$ such that $p_{S'}(\omega) = p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$. Then (i) $S' \subseteq P_\omega$, (ii) $S' \subseteq L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$, and (iii) $S'$ is a moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ in standard position.

_Proof._ (1 $\Rightarrow$ 2) Consider the movement of $S$ inside the hallway $L$. For any angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, there is a moment where the sofa $S$ is rotated clockwise by an angle of $t$ inside $L$. Viewing this from the perspective of the sofa $S$, $S$ is contained in some translation of $L$ rotated _counterclockwise_ by an arbitrary $t \in [0, \omega]$. Likewise, by looking at the initial (resp. final) position of $S$ inside $L_H$ (resp. $L_V$) from the perspective of $S$, the set $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$ respectively.

(2 $\Rightarrow$ 3) Take any $S$ satisfying the second condition, and take its translate $S'$ satisfying $p_{S'}(\omega) = p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$. Then the translate $S'$ of $S$ also satisfies the second condition. So without loss of generality, we can simply assume $S = S'$. 

Since $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$ and $R_\omega(V)$, the width of $S$ along the direction of $u_\omega$ and $v_0$ ([[05. Notations and conventions#^def-width]]) are at most 1. So $p_S(\omega) = p_S(\pi/2) = 1$ implies $S \subseteq P_\omega$.

Since the support function $p_S(t)$ of $S$ is continuous, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ moves continuously with respect to $t$ by [[07. Tangent hallway#^def-tangent-hallway]]. For every $t \in [0, \omega]$, let $g_t$ be the unique rigid transformation that maps $L_S(t)$ to $L$. Then the rigid transformation $S_t := g_t(S)$ of $S$ also moves continuously with respect to $t$. Because $S \subseteq L_S(t)$ by [[07. Tangent hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway-contains]], by mapping it to $g_t$ we also have $S_t \subseteq L$. Because $L_S(0)$ is a translation of $L$ by definition, $g_0$ is a translation map and so $S_0$ is a translation of $S$.

It remains to show that $S_0 \subseteq L_H$ and $S_\omega \in L_V$. Because $p_S(\pi/2) = 1$, $L_S(0)$ is a translation of $L$ along the direction $u_0$, and so the map $g_0$ is also a translation along the direction $u_0$. Because $S \subseteq H$, we also have $S_0 = g_0(S) \subseteq H$. Likewise, since $p_S(\omega) = 1$ the hallway $L_S(\omega)$ is a translation of $L$ along the direction $v_\omega$, and so the map $g_\omega$ is a translation along the direction $v_\omega$. Because $S \subseteq R_\omega(V)$, we also have $S_\omega = g_\omega(S) \subseteq R_\omega(V)$.

(3 $\Rightarrow$ 1) By [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-standard-position-shape]], any connected shape $S$ have a translation $S'$ that satisfies the premise of the third condition. Since $S'$ is a moving sofa, $S$ should be a moving sofa as well. □
