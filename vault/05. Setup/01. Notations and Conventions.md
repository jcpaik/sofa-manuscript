We set up basic notions and conventions that will be throughly used in the rest of the document.

We use the convention $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R} / 2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any function $f$ on $S^1$ and any $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we define $f(t)$ as the value $f(t + 2 \pi \mathbb{Z})$. That is, a real value coerces to a value in $S^1$ when used as an argument of a function that takes a value in $S^1$. We denote an interval of $S^1$ by its lift in $\mathbb{R}$. More precisely, for any $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_2 \in (t_1, t_1 + 2\pi]$, the intervals $(t_1, t_2]$ and $[t_1, t_2)$ of $\mathbb{R}$ are also used to denote the corresponding intervals of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$. Likewise, for any $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_2 \in [t_1, t_1 + 2\pi)$, the interval $[t_1, t_2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is used to denote the corresponding interval of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$.

For any function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ or $f : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(t-)$ denotes the left limit of $f$ at $t$ and $f(t+)$ denotes the right limit of $f$ at $t$. For any function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on some open subset $X$ of either $\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$, and $t \in X$, define $\partial^+f(t)$ and $\partial^-f(t)$ as the right and left differentiation of $f$ at $t$ if they exists.

In this paper, a _shape_ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Denote the area (Borel measure) of a shape $X$ as $|X|$. We define tangent lines and corresponding half-planes of an arbitrary shape $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ as the following.

> __Definition [frame].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R}^2/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$. ^def-frame

> __Definition [support-function].__ For any shape $S$, define its _support function_ $p_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $p_S(t) = \sup \left\{ p \cdot u_t : p \in S \right\}$. ^def-support-function

> __Definition [line].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R}^2/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the line $l(t, h)$ with the _normal angle_ $t$ and the distance $h$ from the origin as the following. ^def-line
$$
l(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h \right\}
$$
> Also, define the line $l(t) = l(t, 0)$ that passes through the origin.

> __Definition [tangent-line].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent line_ $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $l_S(t) = l(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-line

> __Definition [half-plane].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R}^2/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the half-plane $H(t, h)$ with the boundary $l(t, h)$ as the following. We say that the half-plane $H(t, h)$ has the _normal angle_ $t$. ^def-half-plane
$$
H(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h \right\}
$$

> __Definition [tangent-half-plane].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent half-plane_ $H_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $H_S(t) = H(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-half-plane

In this paper, a _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, define the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ as the intersection of $K$ with the tangent line $l_K(t)$. Let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the line segment $e_K(t)$ such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned farthest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned farthest in the opposite direction of $v_t$. ^def-convex-body-edge

Then the product formula is justified when one of the functions is continuous.

> __Corollary [product-rule-differential].__ Let $F, G : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be right-continuous and bounded-variation on some interval $I$. If either $F$ or $G$ is continuous, then we have $d(FG) = F dG + G dF$. ^cor-product-rule-differential

_Proof._ Assume $G$ is continuous. By Carathéodory's extension theorem, it is sufficient to justify that the measure of both $d(FG)$ and $FdG + GdF$ agrees on any $(a, b] \subseteq I$. Using the definitions and that $G(t-) = G(t)$ this is exactly [[#^thm-integration-by-parts]]. If $F$ is continuous we can just flip the roles of $F$ and $G$. □

We give names to parts of the hallway as it will be referenced very often.

> __Definition [hallway].__ The standard _hallway_ $L$ of unit width that rotates 90 degrees is the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = L \cap H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = L \cap V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ respectively. Let $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ be the inner and outer corner of $L$ respectively. Let $a$ and $b$ be the lines $x=1$ and $y=1$ passing through the outer corner $\mathbf{y}$ representing the outer walls of $L$. Let $c$ and $d$ be the half-lines $(-\infty, 0] \times \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0 \right\} \times (-\infty, 0]$ emanating from the inner corner $\mathbf{x}$ representing the inner walls of $L$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [curve-area-functional].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any rectifiable curve equipped with a parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. Write $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. Define the _curve area functional_ $I(\mathbf{x})$ of $\Gamma$ as the following. ^def-curve-area-functional
$$
I(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t)
$$
> Note that $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is rectifiable so is of bounded variation. So the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d \mathbf{x}(t) = (dx(t), dy(t))$ exists and the integral is well-defined. Also, write $I(p, q)$ for the area functional of the line segment $\mathbf{x}$ connecting point $p$ to $q$. Then we have $I(p, q) = 1/2 \cdot (p \times q)$ where the cross product $(a, b) \times (c, d)$ of two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined as $ad-b c$.

If $\mathbf{x}$ is closed, $I(\mathbf{x})$ measures the signed area of the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}$. If $\mathbf{x}$ is a Jordan curve, it measures the exact area enclosed by $\mathbf{x}$ with the sign depending on the orientation of $\mathbf{x}$ ([[02. Geometric Results#^thm-green]]). In general where $\mathbf{x}$ might not be closed, $I(\mathbf{x})$ measures the signed area of the region bounded by the line segment connecting origin and $\mathbf{x}(a)$, the curve $\mathbf{x}$, and then the line segment connecting $\mathbf{x}(b)$ and the origin in order. Note that if $\gamma$ is the join of two curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ then $I(\gamma) = I(\alpha) + I(\beta)$; this will useful in decomposing the area enclosed by the join of multiple curves.
