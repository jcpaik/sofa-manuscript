Here, we prove numerous properties on the support function $p_K$ ([[05. Notations and conventions#^def-support-function]]) and the vertices $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ ([[05. Notations and conventions#^def-convex-body-vertex]]) of a convex body $K$.

> __Definition [convex-body-linear].__ For any function $f$ that maps an arbitrary convex body $K$ to a value $f(K)$ in a vector space $V$, say that $f$ is _linear_ with respect to $K$ if the followings hold. ^def-convex-body-linear

> 1. For any $a \geq 0$ and a convex body $K$, we have $f(aK) = a f(K)$.
> 2. For any$a, b \geq 0$ and convex bodies $K_1, K_2$, we have $f(K_1 + K_2) = f(K_1) + f(K_2)$.

The following is well-known.

> __Proposition [support-function-linear].__ The support function $p_K$ is linear with respect to $K$. ^pro-support-function-linear

We will soon show that the vertices $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ are also linear with respect to $K$. To do so, we compute the limit of vertices via [[05. Vertex and support function#^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex]].

> __Definition [convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection].__ For every $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 \neq t_1,  t_1 + \pi$, define $v_K(t_1, t_2)$ as the intersection $l_K(t_1) \cap l_K(t_2)$. ^def-convex-body-tangent-lines-intersection

> __Lemma [tangent-lines-intersection-linear].__ For any fixed $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 \neq t_1,  t_1 + \pi$, the point $v_K(t_1, t_2)$ is linear with respect to $K$. ^lem-tangent-lines-intersection-linear

_Proof._ The point $p = v_K(t_1, t_2)$ is the unique point such that $p \cdot u_{t_1} = p_K(t_1)$ and $p \cdot u_{t_2} = p_K(t_2)$ holds. By solving the linear equations, observe that the coordinates of $p$ are linear combinations of $p_K(t_1)$ and $p_K(t_2)$. By [[05. Vertex and support function#^pro-support-function-linear]] the result follows. □

> __Theorem [limits-converging-to-vertex].__ Let $K$ be a convex body and $t$ be an arbitrary angle. We have the following right limits all converging to $v_K^+(t)$. In particular, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is a right-continuous function on $t \in S^1$. ^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex
$$
\lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^+(t) = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = \lim_{ t' \to t^+ } v_K(t, t') = v_K^+(t)
$$
> Similarly, we have the following left limits.
$$
\lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K^+(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K^-(t') = \lim_{ t' \to t^- } v_K(t', t) = v_K^-(t)
$$

_Proof._ We only compute the right limits. Left limits can be shown using a symmetric argument.

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Let $p = v_K^+(t) + \epsilon v_t$. Then by the definition of $v_K^+(t)$ the point $p$ is not in $K$. As $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus K$ is open, any sufficiently small open neighborhood of $p$ is disjoint from $K$, so we can take some positive $\epsilon' < \epsilon$ such that the closed line segment connecting $p$ and $q = p - \epsilon' u_t$ is disjoint from $K$ as well. Consider the line $l$ that passes through both $q$ and $v_K^+(t)$. By the definition of $q = v_K^+(t) - \epsilon' u_t + \epsilon v_t$, we have $l = l(t', h')$ for some $t' \in (t, t + \pi/2)$ and $h' \in \mathbb{R}$. Define the closed right-angled triangle formed by vertices $v_K^+(t)$, $p$, and $q$ as $T$. Then $T$ is on the opposite sitde of $H(t', h')$ along the line $l$.

Define $H' = H(t' + \pi, -h')$ as the half-plane opposite to the half-plane $H(t', h')$. We show that $K \cap H' \subseteq T$. Assume by contradiction that there is $r \in K \cap H'$ not in $T$. As $r \in K$, $r$ should be in the tangential half-plane $H_K(t)$. As $r \in H' \cap H_K(t)$ and $r \not\in T$, the line segment connecting $r$ and $v_K^+(t)$ should cross the line segment connecting $p$ and $q$ at some point $s$. As $r, v_K^+(t) \in K$ we also have $s \in K$ by convexity. But the line segment connecting $p$ and $q$ is disjoint from $K$ by how we took $q$, so we get contradiction. Thus we have $K \cap H' \subseteq T$.

We show that for any angle $t_0 \in (t, t')$, the edge $e_K(t_0)$ should lie inside the triangular region $T$. Observe that for all points $z \in K$ which is also in the fan $H_K(t) \cap H(t', h')$, the vertex $z = v_K^+(t)$ attains the maximum of $z \cdot u_{t_0}$. All other points $z \in K$ outside the fan $H_K(t) \cap H(t', h')$ is in $T$ because $K \cap H' \subseteq T$. So the maximizer $z \in K$ of $z \cdot u_{t_0}$ lies in $T$ either way, and so $e_K(t_0) \subseteq T$. Observe that the triangle $T$ contains $v_K^+(t)$ and has diameter $< 2\epsilon$ because two perpendicular sides of $T$ containing $p$ has length $\leq \epsilon$. So both endpoints $v_K^+(u)$ and $v_K^-(u)$ are distance $< 2\epsilon$ away from $v_K^+(t)$. This completes the epsilon-delta argument for $\lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^+(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = v_K^+(t)$. Also, note that $l_K(u) \cap l_K(t)$ is inside $T$ as well, so we also show $\lim_{ u \to t^+ } l_K(u) \cap l_K(t) = v_K^+(t)$. □

From [[05. Vertex and support function#^lem-tangent-lines-intersection-linear]] and [[05. Vertex and support function#^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex]], we have the linearlity of vertices $v_K^{\pm}(t)$.

> __Corollary [vertex-linear].__ For a fixed $t \in S^1$, the vertices $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ are linear with respect to $K$. ^cor-vertex-linear

Moreover, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is right-continuous by [[05. Vertex and support function#^thm-limits-converging-to-vertex]].

> __Corollary [vertex-right-continuous].__ The vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is right-continuous with respect to $t \in S^1$. ^cor-vertex-right-continuous
