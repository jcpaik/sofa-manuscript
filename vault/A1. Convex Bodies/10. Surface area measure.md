We denoted the surface area measure of $K$ as $\beta_K$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-area].__ (Theorem 5.1.7 in p280 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The mixed volume $V(K_1, K_2)$ of any two planar convex bodies $K_1$ and $K_2$ can be represented as the following. ^thm-surface-area-measure-area
$$
V(K_1, K_2) = \left< p_{K_1}, \beta_{K_2} \right>_{S^1} / 2
$$
> Consequently, the area $|K|$ of any planar convex body $K$ can be represented as the following.
$$
|K| = V(K, K) = \left< p_K, \beta_K \right>_{S^1} / 2
$$

We prove the following important equality on $\beta_K$.

> __Theorem [boundary-measure].__ For every interval $(t_1, t_2]$ in $S^1$ of length $\leq 2\pi$, we have the following equality. ^thm-boundary-measure
$$
v_K^+(t_2) - v_K^+(t_1) = \int_{t \in (t_1, t_2]} v_t \, \beta_K(dt)
$$

_Proof._ First we observe that the equality holds when $K$ is a polygon. In this case, for every $t$ the value $\beta_K(\left\{ t \right\})$ is nonzero if and only if it measures the length of a proper edge $e_K(t)$. So the right-hand side measures the sum of all vectors from vertex $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$ along the proper edges $e_K(t)$ with angles $t \in (t_1, t_2]$. The sum in the right-hand side is then the vector from $v_K^+(t_1)$ to $v_K^+(t_2)$, justifying the equality for polygon $K$.  

Now we prove the equality for general $K$. As in Theorem 8.3.3, p466 of [[@schneider_2013]], we can take a series $K_1, K_2, \dots$ of polygons converging to $K$ in the Hausdorff distance such that $e_{K_n}(t_i) = e_{K}(t_i)$ for all $n = 1, 2, \dots$ and $i = 1, 2$. In particular, we have $v_{K_n}^{\pm}(t_i) = v_{K}^{\pm}(t_i)$ and $\beta_{K_n}(\{t_i\}) = \beta_{K}(\{t_i\})$ for all $n = 1, 2, \dots$ and $i = 1, 2$. By Theorem 4.2.1., p212 of [[@schneider_2013]], the measures $\beta_{K_n}$ converge to $\beta_K$ weakly as $n \to \infty$.

For any measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ and a Borel subset $A$ of $S^1$, define the _restriction_ $\beta|_A$ of $\beta$ to $A$ as the measure defined as $\beta|_A(X) = \beta(A \cap X)$. Define $U$ as the open set $S^1 \setminus \left\{ t_1, t_2 \right\}$ of $S$, and $V$ as the open interval $(t_1, t_2)$ of $S^1$. Define $\mu_n$ and $\mu$ as the restriction of $\beta_{K_n}$ and $\beta_K$ to $U$, then $\mu_n$ converges to $\mu$ weakly as $n \to \infty$ because $\beta_{K_n}(\{t_i\}) = \beta_{K}(\{t_i\})$ for $i = 1, 2$. Define $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda$ as the restriction of $\beta_{K_n}$ and $\beta_K$ to $V$. We want to prove that $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ weakly as $n \to \infty$. Take any continuity set $X$ of $\lambda$ so that $\lambda(\partial X) = 0$ and thus $\mu(\partial X \cap V) = 0$. Because $\partial(X \cap V) \subseteq (\partial X \cap V) \cup \partial V$ and $\mu(\partial X \cap V) = \mu(\partial V) = 0$, the set $X \cap V$ is a continuity set of $\mu$. 

Then $\beta_K(\partial X \cap V) = 0$ so . Also, $\partial (X \cap V) \subseteq \partial X \cup \partial V$ and $\lambda(\partial V) = 0$ so $X \cap V$ is a continuity set of $\mu$ (and $\partial (X \cap Y) \subseteq \partial X \cup \partial Y$). 

Let $U$ be the interval $(t_1, t_2)$ in $S^1$, and define the measures $\mu_n$ and $\mu$ as the restriction of $\beta_{K_n}$ and $\beta_k$ to the set $U$.

[[10. Surface area measure#^thm-boundary-measure]] above has the following concise representation in differentials via the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure.

> __Corollary [boundary-measure-differential].__ We have $dv_K^+(t) = v_t \beta_K(dt)$. ^cor-boundary-measure-differential

That is, if we write the coordinates of $v_K^+(t)$ as $(x(t), y(t))$, then the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dx$ and $dy$ of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are $-\sin t \cdot \beta_K(dt)$ and $\cos t \cdot \beta_K(dt)$ respectively. Note that $dx$ and $dy$ are well-defined because $v_K^+(t)$ is of bounded variation ([[05. Vertex and support function#^thm-vertex-bounded-variation]]) and right-continuous ([[05. Vertex and support function#^cor-right-differentiation-right-continuous]]). The proof of [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-boundary-measure-differential]] is immediate from checking that [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-boundary-measure]] matches with the definition of $d v_K^+(t)$.

> __Proposition [equivariance].__ Let $t$ and $\theta$ be arbitrary angles in $S^1$. We have the following equations. ^pro-equivariance
> 
> 1. $R_\theta(v_K^+(t)) = v_{R_\theta(K)}^+(t + \theta)$
> 2. For any subset $X$ of $S^1$, $\beta_K(X) = \beta_{R_\theta(K)}(X + \theta)$.

Now we prove the theorem for general convex body $K$. We claim that it suffices to show the case where $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \pi/2$. First assume the equality for this case. By taking arbitrary $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ and applying $R_\theta$ to the equation we have
$$
v_{R_\theta(K)}^+(t_2 + \theta) - v_{R_\theta(K)}^+(t_1 + \theta) = 
\int_{t \in (t_1 + \theta, t_2 + \theta]} v_t \, \beta_{R_\theta(K)}(dt)
$$
by [[10. Surface area measure#^pro-equivariance]]. Note that $R_\theta(K)$ spans over all convex bodies as $K$ does, so the proof extends to every interval $(t_1, t_2]$ with length $< \pi/2$ and arbitrary $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ by taking suitable $\theta$. Extend the proof to all intervals $(t_1, t_2]$ of length $\leq 2\pi$ by partitioning the interval to a finite number of smaller intervals of length $< \pi/2$ and summing up the equalities corresponding to each smaller interval.
