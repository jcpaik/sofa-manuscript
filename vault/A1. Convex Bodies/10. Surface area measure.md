We denoted the surface area measure of $K$ as $\beta_K$.

> __Proposition [equivariance].__ Let $t$ and $\theta$ be arbitrary angles in $S^1$. We have the following equations. ^pro-equivariance
> 
> 1. $R_\theta(v_K^+(t)) = v_{R_\theta(K)}^+(t + \theta)$
> 2. For any subset $X$ of $S^1$, $\beta_K(X) = \beta_{R_\theta(K)}(X + \theta)$.

We prove the following important equality on $\beta_K$.

> __Theorem [boundary-measure].__ For every interval $(t_1, t_2]$ in $S^2$ of length $\leq 2\pi$, we have the following equality. ^thm-boundary-measure
$$
v_K^+(t_2) - v_K^+(t_1) = \int_{t \in (t_1, t_2]} v_t \, \beta_K(dt)
$$

_Proof._ First we observe that the equality holds when $K$ is a polygon. In this case, for every $t$ the value $\beta_K(\left\{ t \right\})$ is nonzero if and only if it measures the length of a proper edge $e_K(t)$. So the right-hand side measures the sum of all vectors from vertex $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$ along the proper edges $e_K(t)$ with angles $t \in (t_1, t_2]$. The sum in the right-hand side is then the vector from $v_K^+(t_1)$ to $v_K^+(t_2)$, justifying the equality for polygon $K$.  

Now we prove the theorem for general convex body $K$. We claim that it suffices to show the case where $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \pi/2$. First assume the equality for this case. By taking arbitrary $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ and applying $R_\theta$ to the equation we have
$$
v_{R_\theta(K)}^+(t_2 + \theta) - v_{R_\theta(K)}^+(t_1 + \theta) = 
\int_{t \in (t_1 + \theta, t_2 + \theta]} v_t \, \beta_{R_\theta(K)}(dt)
$$
by [[10. Surface area measure#^pro-equivariance]]. Note that $R_\theta(K)$ spans over all convex bodies as $K$ does, so the proof extends to every interval $(t_1, t_2]$ with length $< \pi/2$ and arbitrary $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ by taking suitable $\theta$. Extend the proof to all intervals $(t_1, t_2]$ of length $\leq 2\pi$ by partitioning the interval to a finite number of smaller intervals of length $< \pi/2$ and summing up the equalities corresponding to each smaller interval. 

As in Theorem 8.3.3, p466 of [[@schneider_2013]], we can take a series $K_1, K_2, \dots$ of polygons converging to $K$ in the Hausdorff distance such that $e_{K_n}(t_i) = e_{K}(t_i)$ for all $n = 1, 2, \dots$ and $i = 1, 2$. In particular, we have $v_{K_n}^{\pm}(t_i) = v_{K}^{\pm}(t_i)$ for all $n = 1, 2, \dots$ and $i = 1, 2$.  □

 By Theorem 4.2.1., p212 of [[@schneider_2013]], the measure $\beta_{K_n}$ converges to $\beta_K$ weakly. 

> __Definition [boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, define its _boundary measure_ $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ as the signed measure $\beta_K(dt) = p_K(t) \cdot dt + d \left( \partial^+p_K(t) \right)$ on $S^1$. Here, $dt$ is the Lebesgue measure on $S^1$. ^def-boundary-measure

_Proof._ Note that $p_K$ is [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-support-function-lipschitz|bounded and continuous]] on $S^1$ so we can construct the measure $p_K(t) \cdot dt$ on $S^1$. We use that $\partial^+p_K(t)$ is both [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-right-differentiation-right-continuous|right-continuous]] and [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-right-differentiation-bounded-variation|bounded-variation]] to construct the [[05. Notations and conventions#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-measure-circle|Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure]]. □

This measure is called as the _surface area measure_ for general $n$-dimensional convex bodies. Now we prove [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure]].

_Proof._ (of [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure]]) First, note that $v_K^+$ is both right-continuous and locally bounded-variation so it makes sense to talk about the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dv_K^+(t)$. If $\beta_K$ is defined as [[10. Surface area measure#^def-boundary-measure]], the following chain of equalities justify $dv_K^+(t) = v_t \beta_K(dt)$.
$$
\begin{align*}
v_t  \beta_K(dt) & = v_t p_K(t) dt + v_t  d\left( \partial^+ p_K(t) \right)  \\
& = v_t p_K(t) dt + d\left( v_t \partial^+ p_K(t) \right) - (-u_t) \partial^+ p_K(t) dt \\
& = v_t p_K(t) dt + d\left( v_t \partial^+ p_K(t) \right) + d \left( u_t p_K(t)  \right) - v_t p_K(t) dt  \\
& = d\left( v_t \partial^+ p_K(t) + u_t p_K(t) \right) = dv_K^+(t)
\end{align*}
$$

The first equality ues [[#^def-boundary-measure]]. The second and third equality uses [[05. Notations and conventions#^cor-product-rule-differential]]. The rest uses linearity and definition. The equality
$$
\int_{(a, b]} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^+(a) 
$$
comes from the definition of $dv_K^+(t)$. The inequality
$$
\int_{[a, b]} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^-(a) 
$$
comes from taking the left limit of $a$ in the first equality and using [[10. Surface area measure#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]] on the right side.

We still haven't showed two things. First is that $\beta_K$ is non-negative so is a measure which is not signed. Second is that this $\beta_K$ defined using [[10. Surface area measure#^def-boundary-measure]] is the only measure that satisfies the vertex formulas.

We first show that $\beta_K$ defined using [[10. Surface area measure#^def-boundary-measure]] is non-negative. We only need to show that $\beta_K$ is non-negative near any $t \in\mathbb{R}$. Take the interval $I = \left( t - \pi/4, t + \pi/4 \right)$. Consider the function $f(u) = \cos(u - t)$ on $I$. Both $f$ and $1/f$ are bounded continous functions on $I$. Also for any $a, b \in I$ such that $a < b$, $\int_{(a, b]} f(u) \beta_K(du) = \left( v_K^+(b) - v_K^+(a) \right) \cdot v_t$ is nonnegative by [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-vertex-monotone]]. So $f \cdot \beta_K$ is nonnegative on $I$, and $(1/f) \cdot f \cdot \beta_K = \beta_K$ is also nonnegative on $I$.

Finally, we observe that the $\beta_K$ satisfying the vertex formula $d v_K^+(t) = v_t \beta_K(dt)$ is unique because $v_t \cdot d v_K^+(t) = \beta_K(dt)$ determines $\beta_K$ uniquely. □
