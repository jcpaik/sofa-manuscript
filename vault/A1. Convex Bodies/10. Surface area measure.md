> __Theorem [vertex-monotone].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. Let $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ be any angle. On the interval $t \in [t_0, t_0 + \pi]$, the value $v_K^+(t) \cdot v_t$ is monotonically decreasing. On the interval $t \in [t_0 - \pi, t_0]$, the value $v_K^+(t) \cdot v_t$ is monotonically increasing. ^thm-vertex-monotone

_Proof._ Take two arbitrary values $t_1 < t_2$ in the interval $[t_0, t_0 +  \pi]$. By [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-tangent-line-parametrization]], the points $v_K^+(t_1), l_K(t_1) \cap l_K(t_2), v_K^-(t_2), v_K^+(t_2)$ goes further in the direction of $-v_t$ in the increasing order. This shows that the value $v_K^+(t) \cdot v_t$ is monotonically decreasing on the interval $t \in [t_0, t_0 + \pi]$. A symmetric argument proves the other claim. □

> __Theorem [vertex-bounded-variation].__ On any bounded interval $t \in I$ of $\mathbb{R}$, $v_K^+(t)$ is of bounded variation. ^thm-vertex-bounded-variation

_Proof._ The $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $v_K^+(t)$ either monotonically increases or decreases on each of the intervals $[0, \pi/2]$, $[\pi/2, \pi]$, $[\pi, 3\pi/2]$, $[3\pi/2, 2\pi]$ by [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-vertex-monotone]]. So the coordinates are of bounded variation on each interval. □

We now calculate the left/right differentiation of $p_K(t)$.

> __Corollary [right-differentiation-bounded-variation].__  For any convex body $K$, $\partial^+ p_K$ is bounded-variation. ^cor-right-differentiation-bounded-variation

_Proof._ Use that $v_K^+(t) = p_K(t)u_t + \partial^+p_K(t)v_t$ is [[#^thm-vertex-bounded-variation|bounded variation]] and that $p_K$ is [[#^thm-support-function-lipschitz|Lipschitz]]. □

> __Definition [boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, define its _boundary measure_ $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ as the signed measure $\beta_K(dt) = p_K(t) \cdot dt + d \left( \partial^+p_K(t) \right)$ on $S^1$. Here, $dt$ is the Lebesgue measure on $S^1$. ^def-boundary-measure

_Proof._ Note that $p_K$ is [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-support-function-lipschitz|bounded and continuous]] on $S^1$ so we can construct the measure $p_K(t) \cdot dt$ on $S^1$. We use that $\partial^+p_K(t)$ is both [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-right-differentiation-right-continuous|right-continuous]] and [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-right-differentiation-bounded-variation|bounded-variation]] to construct the [[05. Notations and conventions#^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-measure-circle|Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure]]. □

This measure is called as the _surface area measure_ for general $n$-dimensional convex bodies. Now we prove [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure]].

_Proof._ (of [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure]]) First, note that $v_K^+$ is both right-continuous and locally bounded-variation so it makes sense to talk about the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dv_K^+(t)$. If $\beta_K$ is defined as [[10. Surface area measure#^def-boundary-measure]], the following chain of equalities justify $dv_K^+(t) = v_t \beta_K(dt)$.
$$
\begin{align*}
v_t  \beta_K(dt) & = v_t p_K(t) dt + v_t  d\left( \partial^+ p_K(t) \right)  \\
& = v_t p_K(t) dt + d\left( v_t \partial^+ p_K(t) \right) - (-u_t) \partial^+ p_K(t) dt \\
& = v_t p_K(t) dt + d\left( v_t \partial^+ p_K(t) \right) + d \left( u_t p_K(t)  \right) - v_t p_K(t) dt  \\
& = d\left( v_t \partial^+ p_K(t) + u_t p_K(t) \right) = dv_K^+(t)
\end{align*}
$$

The first equality ues [[#^def-boundary-measure]]. The second and third equality uses [[05. Notations and conventions#^cor-product-rule-differential]]. The rest uses linearity and definition. The equality
$$
\int_{(a, b]} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^+(a) 
$$
comes from the definition of $dv_K^+(t)$. The inequality
$$
\int_{[a, b]} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^-(a) 
$$
comes from taking the left limit of $a$ in the first equality and using [[10. Surface area measure#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]] on the right side.

We still haven't showed two things. First is that $\beta_K$ is non-negative so is a measure which is not signed. Second is that this $\beta_K$ defined using [[10. Surface area measure#^def-boundary-measure]] is the only measure that satisfies the vertex formulas.

We first show that $\beta_K$ defined using [[10. Surface area measure#^def-boundary-measure]] is non-negative. We only need to show that $\beta_K$ is non-negative near any $t \in\mathbb{R}$. Take the interval $I = \left( t - \pi/4, t + \pi/4 \right)$. Consider the function $f(u) = \cos(u - t)$ on $I$. Both $f$ and $1/f$ are bounded continous functions on $I$. Also for any $a, b \in I$ such that $a < b$, $\int_{(a, b]} f(u) \beta_K(du) = \left( v_K^+(b) - v_K^+(a) \right) \cdot v_t$ is nonnegative by [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-vertex-monotone]]. So $f \cdot \beta_K$ is nonnegative on $I$, and $(1/f) \cdot f \cdot \beta_K = \beta_K$ is also nonnegative on $I$.

Finally, we observe that the $\beta_K$ satisfying the vertex formula $d v_K^+(t) = v_t \beta_K(dt)$ is unique because $v_t \cdot d v_K^+(t) = \beta_K(dt)$ determines $\beta_K$ uniquely. □
