For any right-continuous, real-valued function $F$ on either $\mathbb{R}$ or $S^1 = \mathbb{R} / 2\pi \mathbb{Z}$ of bounded variation, we will define its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ $dF$. 

The standard form in literature is the following.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes].__ For any right-continuous function $F : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique measure $dF$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $dF((c, d]) = F(d) - F(c)$ for any half-open interval $(c, d]$ of $\mathbb{R}$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-interval].__ For any right-continuous and monotonically increasing function $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique measure $dF$ such that $dF(a) = 0$ and for any half-open interval $(c, d] \subseteq [a, b]$, $dF\left( (c, d] \right) = F(d) - F(c)$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-interval

_Proof._ Define the extension $F_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $F$ as $F_0(x) = F(a)$ for all $x < a$, $F_0(x) = F(b)$ for all . Restrict the measure $dF_0$ on $\mathbb{R}$ to $[a, b]$ to construct $dF$. □

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-signed].__ For any right-continuous function $F : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ such that $dF(a) = 0$ and for any half-open interval $(c, d] \subseteq [a, b]$, $dF\left( (c, d] \right) = F(d) - F(c)$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-signed

_Proof._ For existence of such $dF$, write $F = F_1 - F_2$ where $F_1, F_2$ are right-continous and monotonically increasing functions.

For uniqueness of $dF$, note that for any two candidates $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ of $dF$, the difference measure $\lambda = \mu_1 - \mu_2$ is zero for all half-open intervals $(c, d]$. □

Define $q : [0, 2\pi] \to S^1$ as the quotient map identifying $0$ and $2\pi$.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-circle].__ For any right-continuous function $F : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ of bounded variation, there exists a unique finite signed measure $dF$ on $S^1$ such that for any half-open interval $(t_1, t_2]$ of $S^1$ with $t_1 < t_2 \leq t_1 + 2\pi$, we have $dF((t_1, t_2]) = F(t_2) = F(t_1)$. Moreover, such $dF$ is the pushforward of $d(F \circ q)$ under $q$.
> ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-circle

_Proof._ We can define the function $F_{real} : [0, 2\pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ naturally as , and take the measure . Then it is natural to define $dF$ as the pushforward of $dF_{real}$ under the map $[0, 2\pi] \to S^1$. □

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-linear].__ The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $dF$ is linear with respect to $F$.
> ^pro-lebesgue-stieltjes-linear

> __Proposition [lebesgue-stieltjes-product].__ Let $F, G$ be real-valued functions on either $S^1$ or a closed interval, so that $F$ is continuous and $G$ is right-continuous. Then $d(FG) = G dF + F dG$.
