For any right-continuous function  defined on a half-open interval $I = (a, b]$, denote its _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ on $(a, b]$ as $df$, which is by definition a measure such that for every $c < d$ in $I$, the measure satisfies $df((c, d]) = f(d) - f(c)$. For any measurable function $g : I \to \mathbb{R}$, denote the integral of $g$ with respect to $d f$ as $\int_{x \in I} g(x) \, df(x)$.

Literature only dealls with $f$ increasing and bounded. Basically, make $f$ work for domain $S^1$.
