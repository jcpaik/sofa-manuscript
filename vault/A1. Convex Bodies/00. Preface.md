Fix an arbitrary planar convex body $K$, which by [[05. Notations and conventions#^def-convex-body]] is a nonempty, compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This appendix defines and proves numerous properties of $K$. An interested reader can read the appendix from beginning to end to verify the correctness of proofs. Still, this appendix is mainly meant to be randomly accessed occasionally when needed.
