Fix an arbitrary planar convex body $K$, which by [[05. Notations and conventions#^def-convex-body]] is a nonempty, compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This appendix defines and proves numerous properties of $K$. This appendix is mainly meant to be randomly accessed only occasionally when needed. Still, an interested reader can read the appendix from beginning to end to verify the correctness of all proofs.
