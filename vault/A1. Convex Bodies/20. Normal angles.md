This section focuses on the set of _normal angles_ of a convex body $K$ defined as the following.

> __Definition [convex-set-support].__ Define the set of _normal angles_ $\mathbf{n}(K)$ as the support of the surface area measure $\beta_K$ on $S^1$. ^def-convex-set-support

If $K$ is a convex polygon $\mathbf{n}(K)$ is the collection of all angles $t$ such that each $u_t$ is a normal vector of a proper edge of $K$. The notion $\mathbf{n}(K)$ generalizes this to arbitrary convex body $K$.

The following theorem is known as the Gauss-Minkowski theorem ([[@marckert2014compact]] or Theorem 8.3.1, p465 of [[@schneider_2013]]). It gives a bijection between any convex body $K$ and its boundary measure $\beta_K$.

> __Theorem [gauss-minkowski].__ (Gauss-Minkowski) For any finite Borel measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ with $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$ there is a unique convex body $K$ with $\beta_K = \beta$ up to translations of $K$. ^thm-gauss-minkowski

By [[20. Normal angles#^def-convex-set-support]], we immediately get the following restriction of [[20. Normal angles#^thm-gauss-minkowski]].

> __Corollary [supported-gauss-measure].__ Let $\Pi$ be any closed subset of $S^1$. For any finite Borel measure $\beta$ on $\Pi$ such that $\int_{\Pi} v_t\,\beta(dt) = 0$, there is a convex body $K$ with normal angles $\mathbf{n}(K)$ in $\Pi$ satisfying $\beta_K = \beta$, which is unique up to translations of $K$. ^cor-supported-gauss-measure

We now collect theorems on $\mathbf{n}(K)$.

> __Lemma [vertex-in-half-plane].__ Let $(t_1, t_2)$ be any open interval of $S^1$ of length $< \pi$. Then for every $t \in S^1 \setminus (t_1, t_2)$, we have $v_K(t_1, t_2) \in H_K(t)$. ^lem-vertex-in-half-plane

_Proof._ Let $p = v_K(t_1, t_2)$. We can either assume $t_1 - \pi < t < t_1$ or $t_2 < t < t_2 + \pi$. In the first case, the points $v_K(t_1, t)$ and $p$ are on the line $l_K(t_1)$ and $p$ is further than $v_K(t_1, t)$ in the direction of $v_{t_1}$. Since $v_K(t_1, t) \in H_K(t)$ we now should have $p \in H_K(t)$. In the second case, the points $v_K(t, t_2)$ and $p$ are on the line $l_K(t_2)$ and $v_K(t, t_2)$ is further than $p$ in the direction of $v_{t_2}$. Since $v_K(t, t_2) \in H_K(t)$ we now have $p \in H_K(t)$. □

> __Theorem [convex-set-support-disjoint].__ Let $K$ be a convex body, and let $(t_1, t_2)$ be any open interval of $S^1$ of length $< \pi$. The followings are equivalent. ^thm-convex-set-support-disjoint
> 
> 1. $(t_1, t_2)$ is disjoint from $\mathbf{n}(K)$
> 3. $v_K^+(t_1) = v_K^-(t_2)$
> 4. Both $v_K^+(t_1)$ and $v_K^-(t_2)$ are equal to a point $p$. Also, $p = v_K^{\pm}(t)$ for every $t \in (t_1, t_2)$ and $p = l_K(a) \cap l_K(b)$ for every $a, b \in [t_1, t_2]$ with $a < b$.
> 5. $v_K(t_1, t_2) \in K$

_Proof._ (1 $\Rightarrow$ 3) Let $p = v_K^+(t_1)$. Then $p = v_K^-(t_2)$ as well by [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-boundary-measure-open]]. We also have $p = v_K^{\pm}(t)$ for every $t \in (t_1, t_2)$ because $\beta$ is zero on the intervals $(t_1, t]$, $(t_1, t)$ and [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-boundary-measure]] and [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-boundary-measure-open]] holds on those intervals. So $p$ is on the line $l_K(t)$ for every $t \in [t_1, t_2]$, and (3) follows.

(3 $\Rightarrow$ 2) is obvious.

(2 $\Rightarrow$ 1) By [[10. Surface area measure#^cor-boundary-measure-open]] we have the integral $\int_{t \in (t_1, t_2)} v_t \, \beta(dt)$ equal to $0$. Now $\beta$ has to be zero on $(t_1, t_2)$, or otherwise the integral taken dot product with $-u_{t_1}$ should be nonzero as well. □

> __Theorem [convex-set-support].__ Let $\Pi$ be any closed subset of $S^1$ such that $S^1 \setminus \Pi$ is a disjoint union of open intervals of length $< \pi$. Then for any convex body $K$, the followings are equivalent. ^thm-convex-set-support
> 
> 1. $K = \bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$
> 2. $\mathbf{n}(K)$ is contained in $\Pi$.

_Proof._ We have $K = \bigcap_{t \in S^1} H_K(t) \subseteq \bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$ always. The equality holds if and only if for every $t$ not in $\Pi$, $H_K(t)$ contains the set $\bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$. Let $(t_1, t_2)$ be any connected component of $S^1 \setminus \Pi$. Then the interval has length $< \pi$ by assumption. Now take any $t \in (t_1, t_2)$. Observe that $\bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t) \subseteq H_K(t)$ if and only if $p := l_K(t_1) \cap l_K(t_2) \in l_K(t)$, as $p$ is the point of $\bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$ farthest in the direction of $u_t$. Then $p \in H_K(t)$ holds for every $t \in (t_1, t_2)$ if and only if $(t_1, t_2)$ is disjoint from the angular support of $K$ by [[A1. Convex bodies/00. something#^thm-convex-set-support-disjoint]]. This completes the proof. □


$v_K(t_1, t_2)$ always inside $H_K(t)$?
