> __Definition [convex-set-support].__ Define the set of _normal angles_ of a convex body $K$ as the support of the boundary measure $\beta_K$ on $S^1$. ^def-convex-set-support

> __Theorem [convex-set-support-disjoint].__ Let $K$ be a convex body, and let $(t_1, t_2)$ be any open interval of $S^1$ of length $< \pi$. The followings are equivalent. ^thm-convex-set-support-disjoint
> 
> 1. $(t_1, t_2)$ is disjoint from the angular support of $K$
> 2. $v_K^+(t_1) = v_K^-(t_2)$
> 3. Both $v_K^+(t_1)$ and $v_K^-(t_2)$ are equal to a point $p$. Also, $p = v_K^{\pm}(t)$ for every $t \in (t_1, t_2)$ and $p = l_K(a) \cap l_K(b)$ for every $a, b \in [t_1, t_2]$ where $a \neq b$.

_Proof._ (1 $\Leftrightarrow$ 2) From $\int_{t \in (t_1, t_2)} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^-(t_2) - v_K^+(t_1)$ we have (1 $\Rightarrow$ 2). Conversely, if $\beta$ is not zero on $(t_1, t_2)$ then the integral $\int_{t \in (t_1, t_2)} v_t \, \beta(dt)$ should be nonzero when measured in the direction of $u_{t_1}$.

(3 $\Rightarrow$ 2) is trivial.

(1 $\Rightarrow$ 3) Letting $p = v_K^+(t_1) = v_K^-(t_2)$, we also have $p = v_K^{\pm}(t)$ for every $t \in (t_1, t_2)$ as well, as $\beta$ is zero on the interval $(t_1, t_2)$. So $p$ is on the line $l_K(t)$ for every $t \in [t_1, t_2]$, and (3) follows. □

> __Theorem [convex-set-support].__ Let $\Pi$ be any closed subset of $S^1$ such that $S^1 \setminus \Pi$ is the disjoint union of open intervals of length $< \pi$. Then for any convex body $K$, $K = \bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$ holds if and only if the angular support of $K$ is contained in $\Pi$. ^thm-convex-set-support

_Proof._ We have $K = \bigcap_{t \in S^1} H_K(t) \subseteq \bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$ always. The equality holds if and only if for every $t$ not in $\Pi$, $H_K(t)$ contains the set $\bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$. Let $(t_1, t_2)$ be any connected component of $S^1 \setminus \Pi$. Then the interval has length $< \pi$ by assumption. Now take any $t \in (t_1, t_2)$. Observe that $\bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t) \subseteq H_K(t)$ if and only if $p = l_K(t_1) \cap l_K(t_2) \in H_K(t)$, as $p$ is the point of $\bigcap_{t \in \Pi} H_K(t)$ farthest in the direction of $u_t$. Then $p \in H_K(t)$ holds for every $t \in (t_1, t_2)$ if and only if $(t_1, t_2)$ is disjoint from the angular support of $K$ by [[00. Preface#^thm-convex-set-support-disjoint]]. This completes the proof. □

The following follows immediately from [[00. Preface#^def-convex-set-support]].

> __Theorem [supported-gauss-measure].__ Let $\Pi$ be any closed subset of $S^1$ such that $S^1 \setminus \Pi$ is the disjoint union of open intervals of length $< \pi$. The correspondence in [[#^thm-gauss-minkowski]] maps the convex bodies $K$ with angular support in $\Pi$ bijectively to arbitrary (nonnegative) measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ with support in $\Pi$ such that $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$. ^thm-supported-gauss-measure

The following theorem is known as the Gauss-Minkowski theorem [[@marckert2014compact]]. It gives a bijection between any convex body $K$ and its boundary measure $\beta_K$.

> __Theorem [gauss-minkowski].__ (Gauss-Minkowski) For any measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ with $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$ there is a unique convex body $K$ with $\beta_K = \beta$ up to translations of $K$. ^thm-gauss-minkowski
