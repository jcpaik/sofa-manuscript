- Extending cap space
	- Helps reducing the amount of work
	- Makes injectivity hypothesis more unlikely
- NOT extending cap space
	- The adjustment argument is much dirtier
	- But all of this is contained in one argument!!

Note: extension of cap space gives much more benefit?
- Pro: You don't need to keep track of width = 1 constraints, that $M_\omega$ weirdness
- Con: The derivation of $\mathcal{A}_1$ formula got benefit from width = 1 all the way
