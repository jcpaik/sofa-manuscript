If $K$ has nonempty interior, it occurs naturally that the boundary $\partial K$ is a Jordan curve bounding $K$ in its interior. So for any different $p, q \in \partial K$, we can think of a Jordan arc $\mathbf{b}$ connecting $p$ and $q$ along the boundary $\partial K$. However, to show that the curve area functional $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{b})$ of $\mathbf{b}$ is well-defined and relates to the surface area measure $\beta_K$ (see [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-param-curve-area-functional]]), we need to contruct an actual rectifiable parametrization of $\mathbf{b}$ and this requires some work.

For every $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_1 \in [t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$, we will define $\mathbf{b}_K^{t_0, t_1}$ as essentially the arc-length parametrization of the curve connecting $v_K^+(t_0)$ to $v_K^+(t_1)$ along the boundary $\partial K$ counterclockwise. The full [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^def-boundary-segment-parametrization]] of $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0, t_1}$ is technical will be given much later. Instead, we start by stating all the properties that agrees naturally with our intuition that we will prove rigorously.

# Definition of parametrization

Fix an arbitrary convex body $K$ and the starting angle $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$.

> __Definition [convex-body-perimeter].__ Denote the _perimeter_ of $K$ as $B_K = \beta_K\left( S^1 \right)$. ^def-convex-body-perimeter

Our goal to construct an arc-length parametrization $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0} : [0, B_K] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of the boundary $\partial K$ starting with the point $v_K^+(t_0)$.

 Take an arbitrary point $p$ on the boundary $\partial K$. Let $s \in [0, B_K]$ be the arc length from $v_K^+(t_0)$ to $p$ along $\partial K$, so that we want $p = \mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(s)$ in the end. As $p$ is in $\partial K$, it is inside the tangent line $l_K(t)$ for some angle $t \in (t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$. Now the arc length $s \in [0, B_K]$ and the tangent line angle $t \in (t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$ are the two different variables attached to $p \in \partial K$.
 
Unfortunately, the relation between $s$ and $t$ cannot be simply described as a function from one to another. A single value of $s$ may correspond to multiple values of $t$ (when $p$ is a sharp corner of angle $< \pi$), and likewise a single value of $t$ may correspond to multiple values of $s$ (when $p$ is on the edge $e_K(t)$ which is a proper line segment). We need the language of generalized inverse (e.g. [[@fortelleStudyGeneralizedInverses]]) to describe the relationship between $s$ and $t$.

The map $g_K^{t_0}$ is defined so that it sends $t$ to the largest possible corresponding $s$.

> __Definition [conversion-ts].__ Define $g_K^{t_0} :[t_0, t_0 + 2\pi] \to [0, B_K]$ as $g_{K}^{t_0}(t) = \beta_K\left( (t_0, t] \right)$. ^def-conversion-ts

The map $f_K^{t_0}$ is defined so that sends $s$ to the smallest possible corresponding $t$.

> __Definition [conversion-st].__ Define $f_K^{t_0} : [0, B_K] \to [t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$ as $f_K^{t_0}(s) = \min \left\{ t \geq t_0 : \beta_K((t_0, t]) \geq s \right\}$. ^def-conversion-st

It is rudimentary to check that $f_K^{t_0}$ is well-defined. We remark that $f_K^{t_0}$ is the minimum inverse $g_K^{t_0\wedge}$ of $g_K^{t_0}$ in [[@fortelleStudyGeneralizedInverses]]. Also we note that $f_K^{t_0}$ and $g_K^{t_0}$ are both monotonically increasing from their definitions.

> __Proposition [conversion-monotone].__ The functions $f_K^{t_0}$ and $g_{K}^{t_0}$ are monotonically increasing. ^pro-conversion-monotone

We will often write $f_K^{t_0}$ and $g_K^{t_0}$ as simply $f$ and $g$ in proofs because our $K$ and $t_0$ are fixed. With the converstions between $s$ and $t$ prepared ($f$ maps $s$ to $t$, and $g$ maps $t$ to $s$), the path $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}$ can be defined by integrating the unit vector $u_t$ for each $s$.

> __Definition [parametrization-formal].__ Define $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0} : [0, B_K] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the absolutely continuous (and thus rectifiable) function with the initial condition $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(0) = v_K^+(t_0)$ and the derivative $\left(\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}\right)'(s) = u_{f_K^{t_0}(s)}$ almost everywhere. That is: ^def-parametrization-formal
$$
\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(s) := v_K^+(t_0) + \int_{s' \in (0, s]} u_{f_K^{t_0}(s')} \, ds'
$$

Note that in [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^def-parametrization-formal]], the function $f_{K}^{t_0}$ is monotone so the integral is well-defined. By a criterion of absolute continuity, $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}$ is absolutely continous with the derivative $\left(\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}\right)'(s) = u_{f_K^{t_0}(s)}$ almost everwhere. Length of an absolutely continuous curve $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the integral of $| | \mathbf{x}'(t) | |$ [[@jones2001lebesgue]], so we have the following.

> __Proposition [parametrization-arc-length].__ The function $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0} : [0, B_K] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is an arc-length parametrization. ^pro-parametrization-arc-length

We haven't yet proved that $\mathbf{b}_K^{t_0}$ does parametrize our boundary $\partial K$ as intended. The following technical lemma handles conversion from/to $s$ and $t$.

> __Lemma [parametrization-set-calculation].__ The followings hold. ^lem-parametrization-set-calculation
> 
> 1. For any $t_1 \in (t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$, we have $\left(f_{K}^{t_0}\right)^{-1}([t_0, t_1]) = [0, \beta_K\left( (t_0, t_1] \right)] = [0, g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1)]$.
> 2. Moreover, the set $\left( f_{K}^{t_0} \right)^{-1} (\left\{ t_1 \right\})$ is either $[g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1-), g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1)]$ or $(g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1-), g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1)]$.

_Proof._ Write $f_K^{t_0}$ and $g_K^{t_0}$ as simply $f$ and $g$. The first statement comes from manipulating the definitions as the following.
$$
\begin{align*}
f^{-1}([t_0, t_1]) & = \left\{ s \in [0, B_K] : \min \left\{ t \geq t_0 : \beta_K\left( (t_0, t] \right) \geq s \right\} \in [t_0, t_1] \right\} \\
& = \left\{ s \in [0, B_K] :  \beta\left( (t_0, t_1] \right) \geq s \right\} \\
& = [0, \beta_K((t_0, t_1])] = [0, g(t_1)]
\end{align*}
$$
Now send $t \to t_1^-$ in the equality $f^{-1}([t_0, t]) = [0, g(t)]$ to obtain that $f^{-1}([t_0, t_1)) = \bigcup_{t < t_1} [0, g(t)]$ is either $[0, g(t_1-))$ or $[0, g(t_1-)]$. Then use $f^{-1} (\left\{ t_1 \right\}) = f^{-1}([t_0, t_1]) \setminus f^{-1}([t_0, t_1))$ to get the second statement. □

> __Lemma [parametrization-pushforward].__ The measure $\beta_K$ on $(t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ is the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on $(0, B_K]$ with respect to the map $f_{K}^{t_0} : (0, B_K] \to (t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ restricted to $(0, B_K]$. ^lem-parametrization-pushforward

_Proof._ Write $f_K^{t_0}$ as $f$. Observe that $f(s) > t_0$ for all $s > 0$ by the definition of $s$, so $f$ restricted to $(0, B_K]$ has range in $(t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$. The first statement of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^lem-parametrization-set-calculation]] then shows that the measure $\beta_K$ on $(t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ and the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on $(0, B_K]$ with respect to $f : (0, B_K] \to (t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ agree on every closed interval $(t_0, t]$ for all $t \in (t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$. □

> __Theorem [parametrization-vertex].__ $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(g_{K}^{t_0}(t)) = v_{K}^+(t)$ for all $t \in [t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$ and $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(g_{K}^{t_0}(t-)) = v_{K}^-(t)$ for all $t \in (t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$. Moreover, for all $t \in (t_0, t_0 + 2\pi]$ the function $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}$ restricted to the interval $[g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1-), g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1)]$ is the arc-length parametrization of the edge $e_K(t)$ from vertex $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$. ^thm-parametrization-vertex

_Proof._ Write $f_K^{t_0}$ and $g_K^{t_0}$ as simply $f$ and $g$. The first statement of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^lem-parametrization-set-calculation]] shows that the measure $\beta_K$ on $(t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ is the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on $(0, B_K]$ with respect to the map $f : (0, B_K] \to (t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ (observe that $f(s) > 0$ for all $s > 0$ by the definition of $f$). With this, we have the following calculation.
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0} (g(t)) & = v_K^+(t_0) + \int_{s' \in (0, g(t)]} u_{f(s')} \, ds' \\
& = v_K^+(t_0) + \int_{s' \in f^{-1}([t_0, t])} u_{f(s')} \, ds' \\
& = v_K^+(t_0) + \int_{t \in(t_0, t]} u_t \, \beta(dt) = v^+_K(t)
\end{align*}
$$
For the proof of $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(g_{K}^{t_0}(t-)) = v_{K}^-(t)$, send $t' \to t^-$ in the equation $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}(g_{K}^{t_0}(t')) = v_{K}^+(t')$ and use [[10. Surface area measure#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]]. By the second statement of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^lem-parametrization-set-calculation]], the value $f(s')$ on the interval $s' \in (g(t-), g(t)]$ is always equal to $t$. So the derivative of $\mathbf{b}_K^{t_0}(s')$ restricted to the interval $[g(t-), g(t)]$ is almost everywhere equal to $u_t$, and $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}$ is the arc-length parametrization of the edge $e_K(t)$ from vertex $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$ on the interval $[g(t-), g(t)]$. □

> __Definition [boundary-segment-parametrization].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. For any $t_0, t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $t_1 \in [t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$, define $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0, t_1}$ as the curve $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0} (s)$ restricted on the interval $s \in [0, g_{K}^{t_0}(t_1)]$. ^def-boundary-segment-parametrization

Now we prove most of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-param-segment]] except that $\mathbf{b}_K^{t_0, t_1}$ is injective (that $\mathbf{b}_K^{t_0, t_1}$ is a Jordan curve or arc). That $\mathbf{b}_K^{t_0, t_1}$ is injective will be proved later.

> __Theorem [boundary-segment-parametrization].__ $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0, t_1}$ is an arc-length parametrization of $\left\{ v_K^+(t_0) \right\} \cup \bigcup_{t \in (t_0, t_1]} e_K(t)$ from $v_K^+(t_0)$ to $v_K^+(t_1)$. ^thm-boundary-segment-parametrization

_Proof._ Write $f_K^{t_0}$ and $g_K^{t_0}$ as simply $f$ and $g$. By [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^lem-parametrization-set-calculation]], the interval $[0, g(t_1)]$ is equal to the inverse image $f^{-1} ([t_0, t_1])$, and so is the disjoint union of the singleton $f^{-1} (\left\{ t_0 \right\}) = \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and the intervals $f ^{-1} (\left\{ t \right\})$ whose closure is $[g(t-), g(t)]$ for all $t \in (t_0, t_1]$. Under the map $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}$, the singleton $\left\{ 0 \right\}$ maps to $\left\{ v_K^+(t_0) \right\}$ and the set $[g(t-), g(t)]$ maps to $e_K(t)$ for all $t \in (t_0, t_1]$ by [[#^thm-parametrization-vertex]]. This proves that the image of the interval $[0, g(t_1)]$ under the map $\mathbf{b}_{K}^{t_0}$ is the set $\left\{ v_K^+(t_0) \right\} \cup \bigcup_{t \in (t_0, t_1]} e_K(t)$. □

> __Theorem [parametrization-joins].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. For any $t_0, t_1, t_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $t_0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2 \leq t_0 + 2\pi$, the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_2}$ is the join of the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_1, t_2}$. ^thm-parametrization-joins

_Proof._ The curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1}$ is an initial part of the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_2}$. So it remains to show that $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0}$ restricted to the interval $[s_{K, t_0}(t_1), s_{K, t_0}(t_2)]$ is $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_1}$ restricted to $[0, s_{K, t_1}(t_2)]$. Observe that the interval lengths match by [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^def-st-conversion]]. The initial point of the two curves is equal to $v_K^+(t_1)$ by [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-vertex]]. We show that their derivatives match, that $\mathbf{x}'_{K, t_0}(t + s_{K, t_0}(t_1)) = \mathbf{x}'_{K, t_1}(t)$ for all $t \in [0, s_{K, t_1}(t_2)]$. By the definition of $s_{K, t_0}(t) = \beta_K\left( (t_0, t] \right)$ and [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^def-parametrization-formal]], it remains to show that $t_{K, t_0}(t + s_{K, t_0}(t_1)) = t_{K, t_1} (t)$. This can be checked using the definition of $t_{K, t_0}$ and $t_{K, t_1}$. □

The boundary $\partial K$ is the union of all the edges.

> __Theorem [boundary-is-union-all-edges].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. Then the topological boundary $\partial K$ of $K$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the union of all edges $\cup_{t \in S^1} e_K(t)$. ^thm-boundary-is-union-all-edges

_Proof._ Let $E = \cup_{t \in S^1} e_K(t)$. $E \subseteq \partial K$ comes from $E \subseteq K$ and that any point in $E$ is on some tangent line of $K$ so its neighborhood contains a point outside $K$. Now take any point $p \in \partial K$. As $K$ is closed we have $p \in K$. So $p \cdot u_t \leq p_K(t)$ for any $t \in S^1$. Assume that the equality does not hold for any $t \in S^1$. Then by compactness of $S^1$ and continuity of $p_K$ there is some $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\epsilon \leq p_K(t) - p\cdot u_t$ for any $t$. This implies that the ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $p$ is contained in $K$. This contradicts $p \in \partial K$. So it should be that there is some $t \in S^1$ such that $p \cdot u_t = p_K(t)$. That is, $p \in e_K(t)$. □

_Proof._ (of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-positive-jordan]]) By [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-joins]] the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t} = \mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + 2\pi}$ is the join of two curves $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{K, t + \pi, t + 2\pi}$ connecting $p = v_{K}^+(t)$ and $q = v_K^+(t + \pi)$ and vice versa. As $K$ has nonempty interior, the width of $K$ measured in the direction of $u_t$ is strictly positive, and the point $p$ is strictly further than the point $q$ in the direction of $u_t$.

We first show that the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi}$ is a Jordan arc from $p$ to $q$. The curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi}$ is the join of the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi-}$ and $e_{K}(t + \pi)$ by [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-segment-parametrization]]. Also, the derivative $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi-}'(s')$ for an arbitary $s' \in (0, s_{K, t_0}(t_1 + \pi -))$ is always a unit vector $v_{t'}$ where $t' = t_{K, t}(s') \in (t, t + \pi)$ so the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi-}$ is strictly monotonically decrasing in the direction of $u_t$. This with the fact that $e_K(t + \pi)$ is parallel to $u_t$ shows that the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi}$ is injective and thus a Jordan arc. A similar argument shows that $\mathbf{x}_{K, t + \pi, t + 2\pi}$ is also a Jordan arc.

Define the closed half-planes $H_0$ and $H_1$ as the half-planes divided by the line $l$ connecting $p$ and $q$, so that for any point $x$ in the interior of $H_0$ (resp. $H_1$) the points $x, p, q$ are in clockwise (resp. counterclockwise) order. We first observe that $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t+\pi}$ is in $H_0$: as the image of $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t+\pi}$ is the point $p$ and the union of edges $e_K(t_1)$ for all $t_1 \in (t, t+\pi]$ by [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-segment-parametrization]], and as $p, q \in K$ and $t_1 \in (t, t + \pi]$ the edges $e_K(t_1)$ should lie in $H_0$. A similar argument shows that $\mathbf{x}_{K, t+\pi, t+2\pi}$ is in $H_1$.

If $K$ contains the point $r$ which is in the interior of $H_0$, then by convexity of $K$ the triangle $pqr$ is contained in $K$. Note again that the image of $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t+\pi}$ is the point $p$ and the union of edges $e_K(t_1)$ for all $t_1 \in (t, t+\pi]$ by [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-segment-parametrization]]. Each edge $e_K(t_1)$ can only intersect with the line $l$ at the points $p$ or $q$ because the triangle $pqr$ is inside $K$. So if $K$ contains some point in the interior of $H_0$, then the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t+\pi}$ connects $p$ and $q$ only using the points in the interior of $H_0$. Similarly, if $K$ contains some point in the interior of $H_1$, then the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t + \pi, t + 2\pi}$ connects $q$ and $p$ only using the points in the interior of $H_1$. Because $K$ has nonempty interior, $K$ contains a point in the interior of either $H_0$ or $H_1$. So in either case the Jordan arcs $\mathbf{x}_{K, t, t + \pi}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{K, t + \pi, t + 2\pi}$ overlap only at the endpoints. This completes the proof that the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t}$ is a Jordan curve. That $\mathbf{x}_{K, t}$ is an arc-length parametrization is [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-arc-length]]. That $\mathbf{x}_{K, t}$ is positively oriented is a consequence of [[yy. Geometric Results#^lem-orientation]]. Finally, use [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-segment-parametrization]] and [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-is-union-all-edges]] to conclude that $\mathbf{x}_{K, t}$ parametrizes the boundary $\partial K$. □

Now we are ready to prove the results we claimed on the boundary of $K$.

_Proof._ (of [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-parametrization]]) The theorem is a combination of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-is-union-all-edges]] and [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-positive-jordan]]. □

Then $\mathbf{x}_{t_0, t_2}$ parametrizes $\partial K$, and is a join of $\mathbf{x}_{t_0, t_1-}$, the edge $e_K(t_1)$, and $\mathbf{x}_{t_1, t_2}$ by [[15.

So it parametrizes $\bigcup_{t \in [t_1, t_2]} e_K(t)$ from $v_K^-(t_1)$ to $v_K^+(t_2)$ by definition.

Let $t_0 = t_2 - 2\pi$. Then $\mathbf{x}_{t_0, t_2}$ parametrizes $\partial K$, and is a join of $\mathbf{x}_{t_0, t_1-}$, the edge $e_K(t_1)$, and $\mathbf{x}_{t_1, t_2}$ by [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-joins]] and [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-segment-parametrization]]. That is, $\mathbf{x}_{t_0}$ is the join of $\mathbf{x}_{t_0, t_1 -}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{t_1 -, t_2}$. This shows that $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_1 -, t_2}$ is either a Jordan arc or curve. □

We compute the area functional of the boundary parametrizations.

> __Theorem [boundary-segment-area-functional].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. For any $t_0, t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $t_1 \in (t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$. The boundary segment $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1}(s)$ of $K$ from $v_K^+(t_0)$ to $v_K^+(t_1)$ has the following area functional. ^thm-boundary-segment-area-functional
$$
I\left( \mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{t' \in(t_0, t_1]} p_K(t') \, \beta(dt') = \frac{1}{2} \int_{t' \in (t_0, t_1]} v_K^+(t') \times dv_K^+(t')
$$

Here, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $d v_K^+(t)$ is well-defined from [[10. Surface area measure#^thm-vertex-bounded-variation]]  and [[10. Surface area measure#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]].

_Proof._ Take any $s' \in (0, s_{K, t_0}(t_1)]$. Let $t' = t_{K, t_0}(s')$ and observe that $t' \in (t_0, t_1]$ and $s' \in t_{K, t_0}^{-1}(\left\{ s' \right\})$. Then as $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0} (s') \in e_K(t')$ by [[#^thm-parametrization-vertex]], we have $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0} (s') \times v_{t'} = p_K(t')$. So we have the following.
$$
\begin{align*}
I\left( \mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1} \right) & = \frac{1}{2} \int_{s' \in (0, s_{K, t_0}(t_1)]} \mathbf{x}_{K, t_0} (s') \times u_{t_{K, t_0}(s')} \, ds' \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \int_{s' \in t_{K, t_0}^{-1}((t_0, t_1])} p_K(t_{K, t_0}(s')) \, ds' \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \int_{t' \in(t_0, t_1]} p_K(t') \, \beta(dt')
\end{align*}
$$
The last equality uses that the measure $\beta_K$ is the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure with respect to the map $t_{K, t_0} : (0, B_K] \to (t_0, t_0 + 2 \pi]$ ([[15. Parametrization of boundary#^lem-parametrization-set-calculation]]). This proves the first equality stated in the theorem. To show the second equality in the statement, check $v_K(t') \times dv_K^+(t') = v_K^+(t') \times v_{t'} \beta_K(dt') = p_K(t') \beta(dt')$. □

_Proof._ (of [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure-area]]) The second equation is exactly [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-boundary-segment-area-functional]]. By Green's theorem ([[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-green]]) and [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-positive-jordan]] we have $|K| = I(\mathbf{x}_{K, 0})$. This with the second equation proves the first equation.

The last equation comes from the second equality and $I(v_K^-(t_0), v_K^+(t_0)) = p_K(t_0) \beta_K(\left\{ t_0 \right\})/2$. Observe $v_K^+(t_0) = v_K^-(t_0) + v_{t_0} \beta_K(\left\{ t_0 \right\})$ from [[yy. Geometric Results#^thm-boundary-measure]] on the interval $[t_0, t_0]$. □



Moreover, if we define $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1 -}$ as the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0}(s)$ resticted on the interval $s \in [0, s_{K, t_0}(t_1 -)]$, then $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1}$ is the join of $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1 -}$ and the edge $e_K(t)$ directed from $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$.

That $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1}$ is the join of $\mathbf{x}_{K, t_0, t_1 -}$ and the edge $e_K(t)$ directed from $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$ is a direct consequence of [[15. Parametrization of boundary#^thm-parametrization-vertex]].
