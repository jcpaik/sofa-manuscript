We first show that the rotation angle of a maximum sofa is exactly $\pi/2$.
Romik showed that the rotation angle should be at least $80^\circ$.
The hard part is to show that near $\pi/2$ but not exactly $\pi/2$. 
Any sofa of rotation $\pi/2$ can be approximated as close as by angle strictly smaller than $\pi/2$.

There is a lower bound on the gap $z_K(t)$ and $w_K(t)$.
Using that, increase the rotation angle.
