Define $\mathcal{K}'_\Theta$ as an extension of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ consisting of all translates of $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$. For every $K' \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta'$, define the origin $O_{K'}$ and the vertex $p_{K'}$ as correspondingly.
A member $K'$ of $\mathcal{K}'_{\Theta}$ is characterized as convex sets with normal angles in $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \left\{ \pi/2 + \omega, 3\pi/2 \right\}$, and width 1 measured in the directions of $v_{\pi/2}$ and $v_{\omega}$.

Fan $\mathcal{F}(K')$ and niche $\mathcal{N}(K')$ is well-defined naturally. This is equivariant under translation.

$$
K' = (H + \mathbf{x}(0)) \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta \setminus \left\{ 0, \omega \right\} } (R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t)) \cap (R_\omega(H) + \mathbf{x}(\omega))
$$

The idea is to adjust $\mathbf{x}$ slightly to increase the value of $\mathcal{A}(K') = |K'| - |\mathcal{N}(K')|$. Let $N = \mathcal{N}(K')$. 

Adjust $\mathbf{x}(0)$ by subtracting $\epsilon_0 v_0$. Adjust $\mathbf{x}(\omega)$ by subtracting $\epsilon_{\omega} u_\omega$. The values $\epsilon_0, \epsilon_\omega \geq 0$ are taken sufficiently small. 
Let $s_u, s_d, s_l, s_r$ be the four sides of $K'$.
The effects on $K'$ (intersection) is subtraction by $\epsilon_0 * (s_u - s_d) + \epsilon_{\omega} * (s_r - s_l)$. 
The effect on $N$ (the niche) is addition by $\epsilon_0 * (n_d) + \epsilon_\omega * (n_l)$.

Note $w \leq s_d - n_d$ and $z \leq s_l - n_l$.

Some choices of $\epsilon_0$ and $\epsilon_\omega$ makes $K'$ not a proper member of $\mathcal{K}'_{\Theta}$ member because of width 1 condition.
We only choose valid $\epsilon_0$ and $\epsilon_{\omega}$ that gives right choice.
1. If $s_u > 0$, then setting $\epsilon_0 = 0$ and pushing only $\epsilon_\omega$ suffice.
2. If $s_r > 0$, then setting $\epsilon_\omega = 0$ and pushing only $\epsilon_0$ suffice.
3. If $s_u = s_r = 0$, then we should push $\epsilon_0 = \epsilon_\omega = \epsilon$ at the same pace. 
This will keep the condition.

Cases:
1. If $z > s_r$ but $w > s_u$, push according to 1
2. If $w > s_u$ but $z \leq s_r$, push according to 2
3. If $w > s_u$ AND $z > s_r$, push according to 3

In all three cases, we can make adjustment that makes $|K'| - |N'|$ larger. Now, it could be that $N'$ is not the niche of $K'$. But note that $\mathcal{N}(K')$ should be contained in $N'$.
