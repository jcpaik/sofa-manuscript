Rotation angle near 90 is the hardest. 

- Show $w_K(t) \geq 9/32$ for any $t$ using `SofaDesigner`
- Either $p_K(0)$ or $p_K(\omega + \pi/2)$ are large enough, larger than say $1.1$. WLOG let $p_K(0) \geq 1.1$.
- Enlarge $t$ just enough from 0 so that $Q^-_K(t)$ consumes all the lower corner of $P_\omega$. Now the sofa has full rotation angle.
