Fix rotation angle $\omega$. Fix a base angle set $\Theta$ and its extension $\Theta'$. Assume $\Theta$ consists of angles $\theta_0, \theta_1, \dots, \theta_n$.

Take any $K' \in \mathcal{K}_{\Theta'}$. We bound $w_{K'}^\circ$. Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ be the relaxation of $K'$. Then $\inf_{t \in (0, \omega)} w_K(t)$ is a lower bound of $w_{K'}^\circ$. Note that the lower bound uses all angle of $t$, not the ones only in $\Theta$.

> __Theorem [bound-wedge-gap].__ For every $t \in [t_i, t_{i+1}]$, we have $w_K(t) \geq \min(w_K(t_{i}), w_K(t_{i+1})) - c_{t_i, t_{i+1}}$ where the constant $c$ is: consider an arc with angles from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1}$ with radius 1. Draw two tangent lines to the endpoints of the arc, so that the arc and the tangent lines form a small region. The maximum length of the intersection of the region and a horizontal line. ^thm-bound-wedge-gap

(need to treat $t$ near 90 degrees separately)

We essentially want a specific point $p$ that needs to be outside the niche, right next to the niche.
In the setting of `SofaDesigner`, $p$ has a determined coordinate.
For every $u_t$, we want $p_K(t) - p \cdot u_t \geq 1$. 

Bounding only one side of niche, we have a lower bound of $9/32$. 
This suffices for angle proof. But this never suffices for
