- Add niche in cap condition
	- Easy
	- Don't know what improvement will this bring
- Allow multiple inequality
	- could help a lot in separting x of distance
	- and give much more stronger constraints

- Another strategy:
	- Divide the intervals A LOT
	- Assume a global constant $\delta$ so that for any $t_1, t_2$ with diff $< \delta$, we have injectivity
	- Then the rest of x's can be bounded by just subdividing a LOT of intervals
