Take any algorithm that computes the intersection $\cap \mathcal{P}$ (resp. the union $\cup \mathcal{P}$) of a finite collection of polygons, with the following property. (e.g. Weilerâ€“Atherton clipping algorithm)

1. Any access to the information $\mathcal{P}$ is done by queries $\mathbf{Q}(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ of form: on which side of $e_3$ is $e_1 \cap e_2$?
2. Along the way, it incrementally updates a polygon $Q$ containing the intersection.

Each query is equivalent to checking if a linear combination of coordinates of $\mathbf{x}_P$. We make a nondeterministic version of the algorithm, where calling a query $\mathbf{Q}(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ does not, but branches both ways.

can be turned into a branch instead. We can turn it into a decision tree.

The general principle is to divide a domain into smaller pieces by half. It's a complete tree. Each node with the set $S$ of inequalities have two leaf nodes $S \cup \left\{ I \right\}$ and $S \cup \left\{ I^c \right\}$. Every leaf node denotes a nonempty subset, or is degenerate with a proof of the set being empty. Or, an upper estimate of $Q$ which is
