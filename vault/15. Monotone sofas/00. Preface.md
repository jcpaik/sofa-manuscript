In this section, we rigorously define monotone sofas in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]. Then we establish a process called _monotonization_ that can take any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in d$ to a larger monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$. Then [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-monotone-sofa]] is a consequence of monotonization. Showing that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected is a key step in establishing the process.

We prove a structural theorem on every monotone sofa $S$ ([[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-structure]]). We show that $S$ is equal to $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$, where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is a convex set called the _cap of_ $S$, and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a subset of $K$ called the _niche_ determined by the cap $K$ ([[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-cap-hallway-intersection]] [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^def-niche]]; see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). Then we show $\mathcal{N}(K) \subseteq K$, so that the area $|S| = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ of $S$ can be understood in terms of cap $K$ and niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ separately.
