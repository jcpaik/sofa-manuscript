In this section, we rigorously define the notion of monotone sofas ([[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]). We establish the _monotonization_, that can enlarge any moving sofa $S$ to a larger moving sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$. We show that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is connected, and consequently . Thus, every moving sofa is contained in a larger monotone sofa, and it suffices to consider monotone sofas for the moving sofa problem.

We show that any monotone sofa $S$ is equal to $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$, where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is a convex set called the _cap of_ $S$ ([[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-cap-hallway-intersection]]), and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a subset of $K$ called the _niche_ determined by the cap $K$  [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^def-niche]]; see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). Then we show that the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is contained in the cap $K$. This way, the area $|S| = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ of a monotone sofa $S$ can be understood in terms of cap $K$ and niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ separately.
