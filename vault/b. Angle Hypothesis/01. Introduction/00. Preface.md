Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [moving-sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed] subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. ^def-moving-sofa

The best bounds currently known on the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ of a moving sofa are summarized as ^eqn-area-bounds
$$
\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \alpha_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1992 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The upper bound comes from a computer-assisted approach of Kallus and Romik in 2018 [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

It is known that there is a moving sofa $S_{\max}$ attaining the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018; @croft2012unsolved]. Specifically, Gerver conjectured that his sofa $S_G$ _is_ the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ and thus the equality $\alpha_{\max} = \alpha_G$ holds at the lower bound [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Numerical experimentations support $S_{\max} = S_G$.[^numerical] Romik [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] derived Gerver's sofa $S_G$ as a candidate of $S_{\max}$ under the following assumptions.

1. $S_{\max}$ rotates clockwise by $\pi/2$ during its movement in $L$.
2. $S_{\max}$ is symmetric along the $y$-axis.
3. The full movement of $S_{\max}$ in $L$ consists of five stages of differentiable movements, in each $S$ makes contact with a specific set of the walls and the inner corner $(0, 0)$ of $L$.

However, all of the assumptions above on $S_{\max}$ remain unproven, leaving $S_{\max} = S_G$ still open to this date.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. ^def-rotation-angle

The first assumption that a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ have rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ seems indispensable in establishing or at least convincing $S_{\max} = S_G$. Romik writes that $\omega = \pi/2$ "seems extremely plausible" [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018], and Romik and Kallus writes that $\omega = \pi/2$ "may well be true even if Gerverâ€™s conjecture is false" [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018], but a moving sofa may rotate less than $\pi/2$ in its full movement ([[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-clipped-sofa]]). Gerver derived his sofa $S_G$ for the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ only without justification (Theorem 2 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]), although it seems that the same calculation could be done for $\omega < \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with rotation angle $\pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Figure [clipped-sofa].__ For any $\omega < \pi/2$ sufficiently close to $\pi/2$, take the intersection $S_{\text{max}} \cap V_\omega$ of the maximum-area sofa $S_{\max}$ and the rotated vertical strip $V_\omega$ ([[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^def-strips]]). Then the intersection is a moving sofa sufficiently close to $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$. ^fig-clipped-sofa

As a progress towards [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]], Gerver showed that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Kallus and Romik later improved the lower bound to $\arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ \leq \omega$ with their computer-assisted approach [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. What makes the full proof of [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]] difficult is that there is a moving sofa sufficiently close to the optimum sofa $S_{\max}$ in its area, shape, and rotation angle $\omega < \pi/2$ (see [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-clipped-sofa]]). This example acts as a barrier for the method of Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018], approximating $S$ by a polygon, to prove the full equality in [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-angle]].

We prove [[#^con-angle]] in this paper.

> __Theorem [angle].__ There exists a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^thm-angle

Our proof does not rely on computer assistance. In [[b. Angle Hypothesis/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]], we first restrict the kinds of sofas to _monotone sofas_, which are the intersection of rotating hallways in convex position. In [[b. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface]], we use the idea of _balancedness_ by Gerver to bound the side lengths of a maximum-area monotone sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Then we prove [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] in [[b. Angle Hypothesis/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface]] by showing that $S_\omega$ with $\omega \in [\sec^{-1}(2.2), \pi/2)$ admits a movement of rotation angle $\pi/2$.

> __Definition [strips].__ Define the horizontal strip $H := \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, vertical strip $V := [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$, and its rotation $V_\omega$ around the origin by a counterclockwise angle $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-strips

> __Definition [parallelogram].__ Let $O = (0, 0)$ be the origin. For any angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, define $P_\omega := H \cap V_\omega$ and $o_\omega := (\tan(\omega/2), 1)$. ^def-parallelogram

(See [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-triangle-full]]) The main step of the proof of [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]] is to show that a triangular region $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from $S_\omega$ ([[b. Angle Hypothesis/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface#^thm-balanced-consumed]]). The monotone sofa $S_\omega$ is always inscribed in the parallelogram $P_\omega$ with lower-left corner $O := (0, 0)$ and upper-right corner $o_\omega := (\tan((\pi/2-\omega)/2), 1)$, making an angle of $\pi/2 + \omega$ at $O$ and $o_\omega$. The region $\Delta_\omega$ is defined as the triangular region near $O$ formed by three vertices $O$, $o_\omega - (0, 1)$, and $o_\omega - (\cos \omega, \sin \omega)$ on the lower boundary of $P_\omega$. Once we show that $S_\omega$ is disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$, we get enough room for $S_\omega$ to rotate _counterclockwise_ by an angle of $\pi/2 - \omega$ inside the horizontal side $L_H$. Follow this rotation of $S_\omega$ in $L_H$ in reverse (so that it rotates _clockwise_ by $\pi/2 - \omega$), and then follow the original movement of $S_\omega$ in $L$, to find a movement of (a rotation of) $S_\omega$ with the full rotation angle $\pi/2$. This will show $|S_\omega| \leq |S_{\pi/2}|$ and thus [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-angle]].

> __Figure [triangle-full].__ The moving sofa $S_\omega$ of maximum area with a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ is inscribed in $P_\omega$ and disjoint from $\Delta_\omega$ (left). So it can rotate counterclockwise by the angle of $\pi/2-\omega$ inside the horizontal side $L_H$ (right). ^fig-triangle-full

[^sofa-translation]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate it at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [[b. Angle Hypothesis/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]).

[^sofa-closed]: Taking the closure of a movable set $S$ does not hurt the movability.

[^numerical]: Approximate solutions found by Gibbs [@gibbsComputationalStudySofas2014] in 2014 and Batsch [@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022] in 2022 deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.
