This subsection reduces the upper side bound down to a finite number of computations.

It relies on the _balancedness_ of optimal solution. The idea is that upper side should be bounded from below by $w$ and $z$.

Once this is done by a limiting theorem, it remains to bound $w$ and $z$ using finite approximation.

> __Definition [angle-set].__ A set $\Theta$ is an _angle set_ with _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ if $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \omega]$ and $\Theta$ is closed. ^def-angle-set

> __Definition [cap].__ Let $\Theta$ be an angle set with rotation angle $\omega$. A _cap_ $K$ with _angle set_ $\Theta$ (and _rotation angle_ $\omega$) is a convex body such that the followings hold. ^def-cap

> 1. $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ and $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$.
> 2. $K$ is an intersection of closed half-planes with normal angles ([[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-half-plane]]) in $\Pi = \Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2\}$.
