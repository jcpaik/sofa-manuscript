This subsection reduces the upper side bound down to a finite number of computations.

It relies on the _balancedness_ of optimal solution. The idea is that upper side should be bounded from below by $w$ and $z$.

Once this is done by a limiting theorem, it remains to bound $w$ and $z$ using finite approximation.
