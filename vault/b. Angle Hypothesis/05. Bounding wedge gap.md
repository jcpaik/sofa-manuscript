We show that the following lower bound of upper sides of $K$ implies the angle hypothesis.

The proof of the bound is computer-assisted and will be the main focus of the rest of the section.

Numbers check: $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203 \dots^\circ$

Leg length = $\cot((\omega + \pi/2)/2) = 1/13$ = The distance between $o_\omega$ and $-u_\omega$ or $-v_0$.

Bound $p_S(\omega) \geq 1.1$ and $z_K(\omega) \geq 1.0$ !
