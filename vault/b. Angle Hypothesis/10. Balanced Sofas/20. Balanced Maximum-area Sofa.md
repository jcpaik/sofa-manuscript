Here, we prove the continuous version of [[b. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofas/15. Balanced Polygon Sofa#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]]. 

> __Theorem [balanced-maximum-area-sofa].__ Fix an angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Let $\Theta_1 \subset \Theta_2 \subset \dots$ be a chain of angle sets with rotation angle $\omega$, so that their union $\Theta = \cup_n \Theta_n$ is dense in $[0, \omega]$. For each $n \geq 1$, let $K_n \in \mathcal{K}_{\Theta_n}$ be a maximizer of polygonal sofa area $\mathcal{A}_{\Theta_n}$ which is also balanced (). Then there exists a cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$ such that the followings are true. ^thm-balanced-maximum-area-sofa

_Proof._  â–¡

- Use Blasche convergence theorem, so that $K_{n_j} \to K$ for some cap $K$.
- In particular $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ . So 
	- Use that surface area measure converges weakly, so the support is still preserved.

We show that $\bigcup_{n} \mathcal{N}_{\Theta_n}(K) = \mathcal{N}(K)$. The containment $\subseteq$ is trivial. We now show the direction $\supseteq$. Take any $p \in \mathcal{N}(K)$. Then $p \in Q_K^-(t)$ for some $t \in (0, \omega)$. As $Q_K^-(t)$ is an open quadrant determined by continuous functions $p_K(t)$ and $p_K(t + \pi/2)$ of $t$ (), we also have $p \in Q_K^-(t_0)$ for $t_0 \in (0, \omega)$ sufficiently close to $t$. Take such $t_0$ in $\Theta$ to conclude that $p \in \mathcal{N}_{\Theta_n}(K)$ for some $n$, completing the proof of $\bigcup_{n} \mathcal{N}_{\Theta_n}(K) = \mathcal{N}(K)$.
