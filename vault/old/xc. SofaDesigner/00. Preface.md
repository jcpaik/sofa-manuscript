Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation: 

> What is the largest area $u_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. The best bounds currently known on $u_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
u_G := 2.2195\dots \leq u_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq u_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $G$ of area $u_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[#^fig-gerver]]). It is conjectured $u_{\max} = u_G$ that his sofa attains the maximum area.

On the other hand, the upper bound $u_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. Approximate the moving sofa by a polygonal intersection $S_\Theta$ of the horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and copies of hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by each angle in a finite set $\Theta \subset (0, \pi/2)$ (see [[old/xb. Upper Bound A1/01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-polygon-sofa]]).[^polygon-sofa] The bound $u_{\max} \leq 2 \sqrt{2} = 2.828\dots$ by Hammersley [@hammersley1968enfeeblement] is obtained by taking a single angle $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/4 \right\}$, and the bound $u_{\max} \leq 2.37$ by Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018] is achieved by taking five specific angles $\Theta$ and estimating the area of $S_\Theta$ from above with extensive computer assistance.

We develop `SofaDesigner`, a computational framework assisting theorems on the moving sofa problem. Using the framework, we prove the following results.

1. We improve the upper bound to $u_{\max} \leq dd$. 
2. We prove the _injectivity hypothesis_. This combined with XX proves the . Full details of the proof of the injectivity hypothesis will be provided in a subsequent series of the paper.

(1) is done by computing the maximum area exactly in a efficient branch-and-bound algorithm. (2) is done by the capability of `SofaDesigner` to not only, but bound _any_ linear functionals on XX in the degree we want. The methodology used by `SofaDesigner` is general enough to apply to Kakeya-type and inverse Kakeya-type problems involving polygons.
