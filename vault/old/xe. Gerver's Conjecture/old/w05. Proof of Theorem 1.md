Here, we show [[old/xe. Gerver's Conjecture/old/01. Overview (WIP)#^thm-left-right]] by assuming the contrary that if $f(K) = \left( \mathbf{x}_K(\theta) -\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/4) \right) \cdot u_0 \geq 0$, then we have $\mathcal{A}_1(K) < u_G$ always.

The actual optima is found by _ansatz_. We use a Mathematica script to find the numerical solution. Then we check if it satisfies the KKT condition. Since we have shown that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave, this local optimality check suffices for global optimality.
