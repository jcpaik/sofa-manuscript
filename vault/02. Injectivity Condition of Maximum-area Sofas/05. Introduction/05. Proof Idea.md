The proof of the main [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] makes modification to the works of Gerver [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] and Romik [@romik]. We give an overview of their works and then explain our idea of the proof of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]].

(See [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^fig-balanced-polygon-combined]]) We first recall the idea of Gerver that a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ should be _balanced_ (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa]] for further details). A moving sofa $S$ is essentially a connected intersection
$$
S := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t
$$
of strips and hallways rotated counterclockwise by each angle $t \in [0, \omega]$. For a finite nonempty subset $\Theta$ of $(0, \omega)$, the discretized problem is to maximize the polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
S_\Theta := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} L_t
$$
instead. Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], with its logical gaps in proof filled out as in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/05. Balanced Sofa]], states that as $\Theta$ gets denser in $[0, \omega]$, some sequence of maximal polygons $S_\Theta$ converge to some maximum-area moving sofa $S$. We call such a maximum-area $S$ _balanced_.

From the balancedness of $S$, we can derive useful equalities on the side lengths of $S$. While Gerver in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] works directly with the sides of the polygons $S_\Theta$, this leads to somewhat complicated calculations. Instead, Romik in [@romik] observed that as we take the limit of $S_\Theta$, the balancedness condition of $S_\Theta$ can be expressed using ODEs involving _differential_ side lengths of $S$.

To give an example, assume that for some angle $t$ and its neighborhood, the rotated hallway $L_t$ makes contact with the balanced maximum-area sofa $S$ at three points $\mathbf{A}(t), \mathbf{B}(t), \mathbf{x}(t)$ as in the right side of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^fig-balanced-polygon-combined]]. Then by taking the limit of balanced sides of polygons, the differential sides of $S$ parallel to the vector $v_t$ (thus with normal vector $u_t$) give the ODE ^eqn-ode-example
$$
\left< \mathbf{A}'(t) , v_t \right> = \left< - \mathbf{B}'(t), v_t \right> + \left< \mathbf{x}'(t), v_t \right>
$$
which is the Equation (20) of [@romik].

Such ODEs are very useful. Indeed, Romik gave a streamlined derivation of Gerver's sofa $G$ using five ODEs like [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^eqn-ode-example]]. Unfortunately, [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^eqn-ode-example]] depends on the assumption that $S$ have three contact points $\mathbf{A}(t), \mathbf{B}(t), \mathbf{x}(t)$, and in order to derive $G$ he had to make the unproven assumption that $S$ have specific contact points in each of five specific intervals of $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.

The main idea of ours is to modify the [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^eqn-ode-example]] to the following _inequality_ that works regardless of the contact points of $S$. ^eqn-ineq-example
$$
\left< \mathbf{A}'(t) , v_t \right> \leq \max\left( \left< - \mathbf{B}'(t), v_t \right>, 0 \right)  + \left| \left< \mathbf{x}'(t), v_t \right> \right| 
$$
Because $S$ is monotone, $\mathbf{A}'(t)$ is always a contact poit. Note that both $\mathbf{B}(t)$ and $\mathbf{x}(t)$ has well-defined extensions over all $t$ even if they are not contact points. Simply let $\mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{A}(t) - u_t$ and $\mathbf{x}(t)$ be the inner corner of the hallway $L_t$.

We sketch the idea behind [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^eqn-ineq-example]], at the risk of being incomprehensible, to give some intuition. The upper bound of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^eqn-ineq-example]] is an overestimation of the sum of side lengths of edges of normal vector $-u_t$. Let $\overline{d}_K(t)$ be the wall of $L_t$ passing through $\mathbf{x}(t)$ in the direction $u_t$.

- The half-line _above_ the line $d_K(t)$ only sees the point $\mathbf{x}(t)$, so the side lengths above $d_K(t)$ are only contributed by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ and thus bounded by $\left| \left< \mathbf{x}'(t), v_t \right> \right|$. This corresponds to the analysis of the region $R$ and value $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ in the proof of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]].
- The half-plane _below_ the line $d_K(t)$ only sees the side $b_K(t)$ passing through $\mathbf{B}(t)$ in the direction $v_t$. So the side lengths below $d_K(t)$ is only contributed by $\mathbf{B}'(t)$, and is bounded from above by $\left< - \mathbf{B}'(t), v_t \right>$ if $\mathbf{B}(t)$ is a contact point, and zero otherwise. This corresponds to the analysis of the value $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ in the proof of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]].

To execute this idea precisely, we first prove the [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]] which works for balanced polygon approximations $S_\Theta$, in which the idea above more precisely. Then we take limit to prove the analogous inequality on $S$ in [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/15. Inequality on Balanced Maximum Caps#^lem-balanced-ineq-limit]], the precise statement of the [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/05. Proof Idea#^eqn-ineq-example]].

As we cannot assume the differentiability along the way, we use the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure in [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Notations and Properties/17. Lebesgue--Stieltjes Measure]] to extend the differential analysis to non-continuous functions. Then we use the Brunn-Minkowski theory and establish [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Notations and Properties/20. Surface Area Measure#^thm-boundary-measure]] that calculates the differential side lengths of potentially non-differentiable convex bodies $K$ in terms of its surface area measure $\sigma_K$.
