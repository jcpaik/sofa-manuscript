Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\alpha_{\text{max}}$ of a connected planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

Such a movable shape is called a _moving sofa_ that we define precisely as below.

> __Definition [hallway-ch2].__ Define the _hallway_ $L$ as the union $L = H_L \cup V_L$ of its _horizontal side_ $H_L = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $V_L = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. ^def-hallway-ch2

> __Definition [moving-sofa-ch2].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is any translation[^sofa-translation-ch2] of a nonempty, connected, and closed[^sofa-closed-ch2] subset of $H_L$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $V_L$. ^def-moving-sofa-ch2

In 1992, Gerver constructed a sofa $G$ of area $\alpha_G := 2.2195\dots$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] which is conjectured to attain the maximum area (see [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver-ch2]]). An important idea of Gerver is that a maximum-area moving sofa $S_{\max}$ should be the intersection of hallways $L_t$, each rotated counterclockwise by the angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ and translated, depicted as grey outlines in [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver-ch2]].

Let $\mathbf{x}_L := (0, 0)$ be the inner corner of $L$. For each $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, define $\mathbf{x}(t)$ as the inner corner of $L_t$ corresponding to the inner corner of $L$. Then the curve $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, called the _rotation path_ by Romik [@romik], determines the moving sofa $S$ and its area $\alpha = \alpha(\mathbf{x})$ completely. Gerver's sofa $G$ is derived so that any _local_ perturbation of the rotation path $\mathbf{x} := \mathbf{x}_G$ of $G$ does not increase the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$.

A major obstacle in showing the _global_ optimality of $G$ is that there is no managable formula of the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ of the sofa that works for all rotation paths $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. All known derivations of $G$ assumes the movement of five specific stages in order to find a workable formula for the area $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992; @romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]. To overcome this obstacle, this [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/00. Preface]] proves the following technical property of a maximum-area moving sofa, called the _injectivity condition_.

> __Definition [unit-vectors-recall].__ Define $u_t = (\cos t, \sin t)$ and $v_t = (-\sin t, \cos t)$. ^def-unit-vectors-recall

> __Theorem [injectivity-abridged].__ (Injectivity condition; abridged) There exists a maximum-area monotone sofa $S_{\max}$ such that its rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable, and we have $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t < 0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t > 0$ for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$. ^thm-injectivity-abridged

[[#^thm-injectivity-abridged]] is an abridged version of the full main [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] that still captures the essence. The main [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] will be used in a subsequent work to prove the global optimality of Gerver's sofa $G$.

We call [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/00. Preface#^thm-injectivity]] the _injectivity condition_ as it implies that the rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of some maximum-area moving sofa have no self-intersection. To see this, observe that
$$
\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot (1, 0) = \cos t \; (\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot u_t) - \sin t \; (\mathbf{x}'(t) \cdot v_t) < 0
$$
for all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$ so the $x$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}(t)$ strictly decreases as $t$ increases. Thus the trajectory of $\mathbf{x}(t)$ forms a Jordan arc with no self-intersection. The portion of the area carved out by $\mathbf{x}(t)$ can be then expressed using Green's theorem. The property will be used in the next work to establish an upper bound of $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ with an workable formula.

[^sofa-translation-ch2]: We allow arbitary translation of a moving sofa $S$ to locate it at any position we want (for example, symmetric along the $y$-axis as in the right side of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]]eface#^fig-gerver]]]).

[^sofa-closed-ch2]: Taking the closure of a movable set $S$ does not hurt the movability.
