Recall the definition of _caps_ in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/00. Preface]]. We have shown in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/15. Rotation Angle of a Sofa/00. Preface]] that a moving sofa of maximum area always have rotation angle $\pi/2$. That is, it should rotate clockwise by the angle $\pi/2$ as it moves inside $L$. Thus, we can safely assume the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ and for the rest of the paper.

> __Definition [cap-space-right-angle].__ Denote the space of all caps $\mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}^{\mathrm{c}}$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ as simply $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$. For the rest, the _space of caps_ will denote $\mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$. ^def-cap-space-right-angle
