We will use the notations defined in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/04. Notations/00. Preface]]. We quickly summarize important definitions and conventions; see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/04. Notations/00. Preface]] for full details.

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a Borel measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote its topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively. The circle $S^1$ is considered as $\mathbb{R}$ modulo $2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. We will often represent an element of $S^1$ as its representator in $\mathbb{R}$. The _one-dimensional Hausdorff measure_ $\mathcal{H}^1$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ measures the length of any line segments and curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

Recall that we define $u_t = (\cos t, \sin t)$ and $v_t = (-\sin t, \cos t)$ for $t \in S^1$. A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. For any convex body $K$, its _support function_ $h_K : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value
$$
h_K(t) := \sup \left\{ p \cdot u_t : p \in K \right\}.
$$
The _Hausdorff distance_ $d_\mathrm{H}(K_1, K_2)$ between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ is the supremum norm of the difference of their support functions.

The _supporting line_ $l_K(t)$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is the line $\left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h_K(t) \right\}$. The _half-plane_ $H_K(t)$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is defined as $\left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h_K(t) \right\}$. The _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ with normal angle $t \in S^1$ is the intersection $K \cap l_K(t)$, which connects the two _vertices_ $v_K^-(t)$ to $v_K^+(t)$ in the direction of $v_t$. The _surface area measure_ $\sigma_K$ of a convex body $K$ is defined, so that for any Borel subset $X$ of $S^1$, $\sigma_K(X)$ is equal to the total length $\mathcal{H}^1(Y)$ of the union $Y := \bigcup_{t \in X} e_K(t)$ of edges of $K$ with normal angles in $X$.
