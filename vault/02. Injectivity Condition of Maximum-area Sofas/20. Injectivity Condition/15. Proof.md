_Proof._ (of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]]) Since $K$ attains the maximum value of sofa area functional ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-cap-max]]), we should have $2.2 < |G| \leq \mathcal{A}(K) \leq |K|$. So it also satisfies the condition (4) of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^def-cap-space-special]].
