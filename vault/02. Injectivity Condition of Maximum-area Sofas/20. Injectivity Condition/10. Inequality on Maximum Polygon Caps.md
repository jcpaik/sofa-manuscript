In this [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps]], we prove [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]] that bounds the side lengths of a maximum polygon cap $K$.

Recall that a balanced maximum cap $K_\infty$ defined as the limit of _maximum polygon caps_ $K_1, K_2, \dots$ converging to $K$ in Hausdorff distance $d_\text{H}$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^def-balanced-maximum-cap]]). Each maximum polygon cap $K_i$ have angle set $\Theta_{n_i} := \left\{ (\pi/2) j / n_i : 1 \leq j < n_i \right\}$ where $1 < n_1 < n_2 < \dots$ are increasing powers of 2. To refer each polygon cap $K_i$ more easily, we introduce the following notion. We will bound the arm lengths of a balanced maximum cap.

> __Definition [simple-notation-balanced-cap].__ Say that $K \in \mathcal{K}$ is a _balanced polygon cap_ with $n$ _steps_ of _step size_ $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$, if $n > 1$ and $n$ is a power of two, and $K$ is a balanced polygon cap with the angle set $\Theta_n := \left\{ (\pi/2) i / n : 1 \leq i < n \right\}$. ^def-simple-notation-balanced-cap

The main [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]] of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa|20. Balanced Maximum Sofa]] is that each maximum polygon cap $K = K_i$ is _balanced_ in the side lengths of $K_i$ and its polygon niche. Using this balancedness condition, we will establish an upper bound of the surface area measure $\sigma_{K}$ of a balanced polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps of step size $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$ in [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq]]. Then we will take the limit $n \to \infty$ and accordingly $\delta \to 0$, so that the polygon cap $K$ converges to the balanced maximum cap $K_{\infty}$ with its surface area measure $\sigma_{K_\infty}$ bounded from above. We use the following [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^def-o-notation]] to control the error terms bounded by absolute functions of $\delta$.

> __Definition [o-notation].__ For any real-valued expressions $f$ and $g$ of $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$, write $f(\delta) = O_\delta(g(\delta))$ if the value of $g(\delta)$ depends solely on $\delta$, and there are absolute constants $C, \epsilon > 0$ such that for every $|\delta| < \epsilon$, we have $|f(\delta)| \leq C g(\delta)$. ^def-o-notation

Note that in [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^def-o-notation]], the value $f(\delta)$ might depend on other values than $\delta$, but the value of $g(\delta)$ should depend solely on $\delta$. For example, we can write $\delta^2 / (1 + h_K(0)^2) = O_\delta(\delta^2)$ where $K \in \mathcal{K}$ can be arbitrary, but we cannot write $\delta^2 = O_\delta(\delta^2(1+p_K(0)^2))$ as the value inside $O_\delta$ is not determined by $\delta$ only.

> __Lemma [leg-bounded].__ Any balanced polygon cap $K$ with $n$ steps have the diameter at most $5$. Consequently, the functions $f_K^{\pm}$ and $g_K^{\pm}$ are bounded from above by 5. ^lem-leg-bounded

_Proof._ Since $n > 1$ is a power of two by [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^def-simple-notation-balanced-cap]], the angle set $\Theta_n$ of $K$ contains the angle $\pi/4$. By [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-cap-connected]], the cap $K$ satisfies the condition (1) of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Cap Contains Niche#^thm-monotonization-connected-iff]]. So the cap $K$ also satisfies the condition (3) of [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/05. Monotone Sofa/15. Cap Contains Niche#^thm-monotonization-connected-iff]], and the $y$-coordinate of $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/4)$ is at most one. Now $K \subseteq H \cap Q_K^+(\pi/4)$ and the polygon $H \cap Q_K^+(\pi/4)$ have diameter at most $2 + 2\sqrt{2} < 5$. So $K$ have the diameter at most 5.

By [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/05. Arm Lengths#^def-cap-tangent-arm-length]], for any $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ we have $A_K^{\pm}(t) - C_K^{\pm}(t) = - f_K^{\pm}(t) v_t + g_K^{\pm}(t) u_t$ and since $A_K^{\pm}(t), C_K^{\pm}(t)$ are in $K$, the values $f_K^{\pm}(t)$ and $g_K^{\pm}(t)$ are also bounded by the diameter of $K$ which is at most 5. â–¡

> __Lemma [leg-computation].__ For any balanced polygon cap $K$ with the angle set $\Theta$ of step size $\delta$, and any angle $t \in \Theta$, we have the following calculations. ^lem-leg-computation
> 
> 1. $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta)) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1 + \tan(\delta / 2))$
> 2. $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t + \delta)) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, 1 - g_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta / 2))$

_Proof._ (1) See the left side of [[#^fig-leg-computation]]. Let $p$ be the intersection of $\bar{d}_K(t - \delta)$ and $\bar{b}_K(t)$, depicted orange in the figure. Since $p \in \bar{b}_K(t)$, there is a unique real value $\alpha$ such that $p + \alpha v_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. As $b_K(t)$ is the half-line from $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ extending in the direction of $-v_t$, we have $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$ and it remains to evaluate $\alpha$. Define $q$ as the intersection of $\bar{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\bar{d}_K(t)$, depicted green in the figure, and $\beta$ as the unique real value such that $q + \beta u_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. Since the points $p$, $q$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ form a right-angled triangle of angle $\delta$ at $q$, we have $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot \beta$. It remains to compute $\beta$.

Let $r$ be the intersection of $c_K(t - \delta)$ and $c_K(t)$, depicted blue in the figure. Since the lines $c_K(t)$ and $d_K(t)$ are parallel of distance one, and so are $c_K(t - \delta)$ and $d_K(t - \delta)$, and the two pairs of lines make an angle of $\delta$, follow the dashed lines in the figure and we get $r = q + v_t + \tan(\delta / 2) u_t$. As $K$ have angle set $\Theta$ and the angles $t$ and $t + \delta$ are adjacent, we have $r = C_K^-(t)$. By [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/05. Arm Lengths#^lem-cap-tangent-arm-length]] we have $r + g_K^-(t) u_t = \mathbf{y}_K(t)$. Summing up, we now have
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta & = (\mathbf{x}_K(t) - q) \cdot u_t = (\mathbf{x}_K(t) + v_t + \tan(\delta/2) u_t - r) \cdot u_t \\
& = (\mathbf{x}_K(t) + v_t + \tan(\delta / 2) u_t - \mathbf{y}_K(t) + g_K^-(t)u_t) \cdot u_t \\
& = g_K^-(t) + \tan(\delta/2) - 1
\end{align*}
$$
and the result follows from $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, \beta)$.

(2) The proof is analogous to that of (1). See the right side of [[#^fig-leg-computation]]. Let $p$ be the intersection of $\bar{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\bar{b}_K(t)$. Since $p \in \bar{b}_K(t)$ there is a unique real value $\alpha$ such that $p + \alpha v_t = \mathbf{x}_K(t)$. As $b_K(t)$ is the half-line from $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ extending in the direction of $-v_t$, we have $\mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t + \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0)$ and it remains to evaluate $\alpha$. Define $q$ as the intersection of $\bar{d}_K(t + \delta)$ and $\bar{d}_K(t)$, and $\beta$ as the unique real value such that $\mathbf{x}_K(t) + \beta u_t = q$. Since the points $p$, $q$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ form a right-angled triangle of angle $\delta$ at $q$, we have $\alpha = \tan \delta \cdot \beta$. It remains to compute $\beta$.

Let $r$ be the intersection of $c_K(t + \delta)$ and $c_K(t)$. Since the lines $c_K(t)$ and $d_K(t)$ are parallel of distance one, and so are $c_K(t + \delta)$ and $d_K(t + \delta)$, and the two pairs of lines make an angle of $\delta$, we have $r = q + v_t - \tan(\delta / 2) u_t$. As $K$ have angle set $\Theta$ and the angles $t$ and $t + \delta$ are adjacent, we have $r = C_K^+(t)$. By [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/05. Arm Lengths#^lem-cap-tangent-arm-length]] we have $r + g_K^+(t) u_t = \mathbf{y}_K(t)$. Summing up, we now have
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta & = (q - \mathbf{x}_K(t)) \cdot u_t = (- \mathbf{x}_K(t) - v_t + \tan(\delta/2) u_t + r) \cdot u_t \\
& = (-\mathbf{x}_K(t) - v_t + \tan(\delta / 2) u_t + \mathbf{y}_K(t) - g_K^+(t)u_t) \cdot u_t \\
& = 1 - g_K^+(t) + \tan(\delta/2)
\end{align*}
$$
and the result follows from $\mathcal{H}^1(d_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{b}(t - \delta)) = \max(\alpha, 0) = \tan \delta \cdot \max(0, \beta)$. â–¡

We introduce the following auxiliary real functions. Note that $m_0$ is monotonically increasing, and is a piecewise function that satisfies $m_0(0) = -1$, $m_0(1) = 1/2$, $m_0(x) = 1$ for $x \geq 2$.

> __Definition [magic-function].__ Define $k_0, m_0 : \mathbb{R}_{\geq0} \to \mathbb{R}$ as $k_0(x) := \max\left( |x - 1|, (|x - 1| + 1) / 2 \right)$ and $m_0(x) = x - k_0(x)$. ^def-magic-function

We now bound the side lengths of a maximum polygon cap, using its balancedness. This is the most important part of the analysis.

> __Lemma [balanced-discrete-ineq].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ be any maximum polygon cap of $n$ steps with step size $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$ and uniform angle set $\Theta := \Theta_n$. Take any $t \in \left\{ 0 \right\} \cup \Theta$. We have the following upper bound of side length $\sigma_K(t)$. ^lem-balanced-discrete-ineq
$$
\sigma_K(t) \leq k_0(g_K^+(t)) \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$

_Proof._ If $t = 0$, then as $K$ have angle set $\Theta$ and rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$, it is an intersection of a finite number of half-planes with normal angles $\neq 0 \in S^1$ (see [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^def-angled-cap-space]]). So we have $\sigma_K(t) = 0$ and the bound holds trivially. Now assume $t \in \Theta$.

Write $s := \sigma_K(t)$. Because $K$ is balanced by [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]], we have $s = \tau_K(t)$. By [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^lem-polyline-length]], the value $\tau_K(t) = \mathcal{H}^1(X)$ is the length of the set $X := b_K(t) \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, the side(s) of the polygon niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ contributed by the half-line $b_K(t)$ form $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. We will bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X)$ from above, thus bounding $s$.

Define the set $U := \left\{ t - \delta, t, t + \delta \right\}$ and $R := \bigcup_{u \in U} H_K^\mathrm{d} (u)$ as the union of three half-planes. Divide $X$ into $X \cap R$ and $X \setminus R$. We bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ and $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ from above separately.

We first bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R)$ from above. As $X \subseteq b_K(t)$, we have
$$
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) \leq \mathcal{H}^1(b_K(t) \cap R) = \max(b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t - \delta), b_K(t) \cap H_K^\mathrm{d}(t + \delta))
$$
and by the computation in [[#^lem-leg-computation]] and [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/10. Inequality on Maximum Polygon Caps#^lem-leg-bounded]], we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) & \leq \delta \cdot \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^+(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
\end{align*}
$$
Let $M = \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1, 1 - g_K^+(t))$. We have $g_K^-(t) \leq g_K^+(t)$ by definition. So if $g_K^-(t) \leq 1$ then $M = \max(0, 1 - g_K^+(t)) \leq |1 - g_K^+(t)|$. If $g_K^-(t) > 1$ then we have $M = \max(0, g_K^-(t) - 1) \leq |1 - g_K^+(t)|$. Either way, we have $M \leq |1 - g_K^+(t)|$ and ^eqn-bound-x-r
$$
\mathcal{H}^1(X \cap R) \leq \left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2).
$$

Now we bound $\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R)$ from above. Define the closed region $S := \bigcap_{u \in U} H_K^\mathrm{b} (u)$. Our intermediate goal is to show $X \setminus R \subseteq S$. Define $H_0 := H_+(\pi/2, 0)$ as the closed half-plane above the $x$-axis. Then, since $H_0 \cap \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is an open set, $H_0 \cap \partial \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ is disjoint from $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. 

For every $u \in U$, we have $Q_K^-(u) \cup H_K^\mathrm{b}(u) \cup H_K^\mathrm{d}(u) = \mathbb{R}^2$. So
$$
X \subseteq H_0 \setminus \mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \subseteq H_0 \setminus \bigcup_{u \in U} Q_K^-(u) \subseteq H_0 \cap \bigcap_{u \in U} (H_K^\mathrm{b}(u) \cup H_K^\mathrm{d}(u))
\subseteq H_0 \cap (R \cup S). 
$$

We just have shown that $X \setminus R \subseteq S$ where $S := \bigcap_{u \in U} H_K^\mathrm{b} (u)$ is the intersection of three closed half-planes with normal angles $u \in U$ and boundaries $\bar{b}_K(u)$. By definition of $X$, we have $X \subseteq \bar{b}_K(t)$ and $X \setminus R \subseteq \bar{b}_K(t) \cap S$. Define the intersections $B_+ := \bar{b}_K(t) \cap \bar{b}_K(t + \delta)$ and $B_- := \bar{b}_K(t) \cap \bar{b}_K(t - \delta)$. There is a unique real value $\beta$ such that $B_+ = B_- - \beta v_t$. Elementary geometry shows that the side $\bar{b}_K(t) \cap S$ of $S$ is empty if $\beta < 0$, or is a finite segment of length $\beta$ if $\beta \geq 0$. On the other hand, XX shows that $\beta = 2 \tan (\delta / 2) - \sigma_K(t)$. So ^eqn-bound-x-not-r
$$
\mathcal{H}^1(X \setminus R) \leq \max(0, 2 \tan (\delta / 2) - \sigma_K(t)) = \max(0, \delta - s) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
$$

Recall that $s = \nu_K(t) = \mathcal{H}^1(X)$. We divide the proof into cases on whether $s \leq \delta$ or not. If $s \leq \delta$, then adding [[#^eqn-bound-x-r]] and [[#^eqn-bound-x-not-r]] gives
$$
s \leq \left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| \cdot \delta + \delta - s + O_\delta(\delta^2)
$$
so rearranging gives
$$
s \leq (\left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| + 1)/2 \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2) \leq k_0(g_K^+(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
$$
On the other hand, if $s > \delta$, then adding [[#^eqn-bound-x-r]] and [[#^eqn-bound-x-not-r]] gives
$$
s \leq \left| g_K^+(t) - 1 \right| \cdot \delta + O_\delta(\delta^2) \leq k_0(g_K^+(t)) + O_\delta(\delta^2).
$$
Either way, the claimed inequality holds. â–¡
