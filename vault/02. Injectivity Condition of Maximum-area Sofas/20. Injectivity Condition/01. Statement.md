We fully state the main [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]] of this paper. Recall that a _balanced maximum cap_ $K$ is the cap of a _balanced maximum sofa_ $S$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ attaining the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ ([[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-sofa]]). Note that the following [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^def-injectivity-condition]] also defines the notions $r_K$ and $s_K$ for $K$ satisfying the injectivity condition.

> 1. There exists measurable functions $r_K, s_K : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, unique up to measure zero, such that $\sigma_K = r_K(t) \mathrm{d} t$ on $t \in [0, \pi/2)$ and $\sigma_K = s_K(t - \pi/2) \mathrm{d} t$ on $t \in (\pi/2, \pi]$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable.
> 3. For all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$, we have $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot u_t < 0$ and $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot v_t > 0$.

We note that the cap of Gerver's sofa $G$ also satisfies the injectivity condition, although we are yet to prove that its cap $K$ is a _maximum_ cap, that is, $G$ attains the maximum area.

> __Remark [injectivity-gerver].__ We do not give an explicit proof of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity-gerver]] which boils down to technical computations. Note that a slightly weaker version $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot u_t \leq 0$ and $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot v_t \geq 0$ of (3) of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^def-injectivity-condition]] is already assumed (not proved) by Romik [@romik] in order to give a derivation of Gerver's sofa $G$. Although Romik also does not explicitly plug the derived $G$ back in order to check the assumed inequalities, the equations determining $G$ provided in [@romik] should be sufficient to check [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity-gerver]] formally. ^rem-injectivity-gerver
