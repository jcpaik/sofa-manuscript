We fully state the main [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]] of this paper. The full statement depends on the definitions made in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa|20. Balanced Maximum Sofa]]. In particular, [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-sofa]] states that a _balanced maximum sofa_ $S_{\infty}$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ attaining the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ exists. Such a sofa $S_{\infty}$ is a monotone sofa with a _balanced maximum cap_ $K$ defined in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^def-balanced-maximum-sofa]]. The full injectivity condition holds for any balanced maximum cap $K$.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ (Injectivity condition) Any balanced maximum cap $K \in \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$ satisfies the following properties. ^thm-injectivity
> 
> 1. For any $t \in [0, \pi] \setminus \left\{ \pi/2 \right\}$ we have $\sigma_K(t) = 0$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable.
> 3. For all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$, we have $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot u_t < 0$ and $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot v_t > 0$.

Note that (1) of[[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]] implies that $A_K^+(t) = A_K^-(t)$ and $f_K^+(t) = f_K^-(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. We will denote the common value as $A_K(t)$ and $f_K(t)$ respectively (). Along the process of showing [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]], we will also show that there are measurable functions $r_K, s_K : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that the measure $\sigma_K$ on interval $[0, \pi/2)$ and $(\pi/2, \pi]$ have density functions $r_K$ and $s_K$ respectively. We will use these notions on balanced maximum caps in the subsequent work.
