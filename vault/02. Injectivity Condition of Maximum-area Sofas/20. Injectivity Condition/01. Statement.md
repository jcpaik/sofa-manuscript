We fully state the main [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]] of this paper.

The full statement uses the definitions made in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa|20. Balanced Maximum Sofa]]. In particular, [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^thm-limiting-maximum-sofa]] states that a _balanced maximum sofa_ $S_{\infty}$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ attaining the maximum area $\alpha_{\max}$ exists. Such a sofa $S_{\infty}$ is a monotone sofa with a _balanced maximum cap_ $K$ defined in [[01. Rotation Angle of Maximum-area Sofas/10. Balanced Sofa/20. Balanced Maximum Sofa#^def-balanced-maximum-sofa]]. The full injectivity condition holds for any balanced maximum cap $K$.

Note that (1) of[[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]] implies that $A_K^+(t) = A_K^-(t)$ and $f_K^+(t) = f_K^-(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2)$. We will denote the common value as $A_K(t)$ and $f_K(t)$ respectively (). Along the process of showing [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity]], we will also show that there are measurable functions $r_K, s_K : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that the measure $\sigma_K$ on interval $[0, \pi/2)$ and $(\pi/2, \pi]$ have density functions $r_K$ and $s_K$ respectively. We will use these notions on balanced maximum caps in the subsequent work.

> __Remark [injectivity-gerver].__ We do not give an explicit proof of [[02. Injectivity Condition of Maximum-area Sofas/20. Injectivity Condition/01. Statement#^thm-injectivity-gerver]], which basically boils down to lengthy and technical computations. Note, however, that a weaker version of (3) is _assumed_ by Romik in [@romik] to derive Gerver's sofa $G$.  ^rem-injectivity-gerver
