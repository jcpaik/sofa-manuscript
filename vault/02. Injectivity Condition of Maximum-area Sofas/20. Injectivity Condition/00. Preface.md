We fully state the injectivity condition, which is the main theorem of this paper.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ There is a cap $K \in \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c}$ maximizing the value of the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{c} \to \mathbb{R}$, such that it also satisfies the following conditions. ^thm-injectivity
> 
> 1. For any $t \in [0, \pi] \setminus \left\{ \pi/2 \right\}$ we have $\sigma_K\left( \left\{ t \right\} \right) = 0$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuously differentiable.
> 3. For all $t \in (0, \pi/2)$, we have $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot u_t < 0$ and $\mathbf{x}_K'(t) \cdot v_t > 0$.
