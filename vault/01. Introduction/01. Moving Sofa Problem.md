In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following question, now known as the _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area $\mu$ that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define a planar set $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 0] \times [-1, 0]$ and $L_V = [-1, 0] \times (-\infty, 0]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ can be defined as a planar subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. The maximum area $\mu$ of a moving sofa remains unknown,  despite decades of attempts and partial progresses.

The largest known area of a moving sofa was improved over decades by many people, until Gerver constructed in 1994 a moving sofa $S_G$ with the area $\mu_G := 2.2195\cdots$ which still holds the currently best record.

Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area.

Indeed, numerical experiments by Gibbs [[@gibbsComputationalStudySofas]] give polygonal shapes resembling the shape of Gerver's sofa, suggesting that Gerver's conjecture is indeed true. Gerver also derived his sofa from local optimality considerations.

It is known that there exists a moving sofa which attains the maximum area $\mu_M$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. The best known bounds on $\mu_M$ so far can be summarized as the following. 
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37
$$
The area of Gerver's sofa immediately gives the lower bound $2.2195\dots$ of $\mu_M$. On the other hand, the work of Romik and Kallus [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] shows the best upper bound $2.37$ of $\mu_M$ known so far. They devised an algorithm that computes an upper bound $\mu_U$ of $\mu_M$ that converges $\mu_M$ when ran indefinitely. However, this does not solve the moving sofa problem, as it is impossible to determine the value that $\mu_U$ converges to by running the algorithm for a finite time. They proved a concrete upper bound $2.37$ by running their implementation `SofaBounds` of their algorithm.

In this paper, we propose the _injectivity hypothesis_ which is a weaker conjecture implied by Gerver's conjecture. The hypothesis essentially states that there exists a moving sofa $S$ of maximum area such that the followings hold.

- $S$ rotates $90$ degrees clockwise as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$.
- The trajectory $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of the inner corner does not self-intersect nor goes below the bottom side of the sofa.

The _rotation angle_ of a moving sofa is the clockwise angle that it rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa has the rotation angle $\pi/2$. Let $\omega$ be the rotation angle of an arbitrary sofa of maximum area. [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] showed that $\omega \in [\pi/3, \pi/2]$, and [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] improved this by showing that $\omega = [\arcsin(84/85), \pi/2]$ where $\arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^{\circ}$.

He viewed the movement from the frame of reference of the sofa, in which the sofa is fixed and the hallway is rotated and translated. Following the description suggested by Romik [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]], Gerver essentially considered a moving sofa $S$ as the intersection (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]) of a unit-width strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [-1, 0]$ and a continuum of hallways $L_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ with inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$. Assuming five particular stages of the sofa movement, Gerver solved for the local optimality condition on $\mathbf{x}(t)$ where perturbing $\mathbf{x}$ does not increase the area of sofa to derive his sofa $S_G$.

Assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we prove a new upper bound $\mu_M \le 1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2338\dots$ which is much closer to the area of Gerver's sofa. Moreover, we show that if Gerver's conjecture is true _a priori_, which is suggested by the experiments in [[@gibbsComputationalStudySofas]], then a modification of an algorithm by Romik and Kallus [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] is able to terminate in finite time and prove the injectivity hypothesis without relying on the a priori assumption.

In Section 1, we define _monotone sofas_ as a special subset of monotone sofas, and show that there is a sofa with maximum area which is monotone. A monotone sofa always consists of a convex set called the _cap_ subtracted by its _niche_ (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). With this, we turn the moving sofa problem to maximizing the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on the space of caps. In Section 2, we state the full statement of the injectivity hypothesis. In Section 3, assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we construct a concave upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and show that the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$.
