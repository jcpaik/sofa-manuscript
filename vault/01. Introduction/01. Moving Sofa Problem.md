Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ ([[01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-gerver]]) constructed in 1994. Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, so that $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$, and approximate solutions found by computer experiments are consistent with his conjecture.[^experiments] On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] using computer assistance.

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa has the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Let $\omega$ is the rotation angle of a moving sofa of maximum area. Gerver showed in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] that we can assume $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$. Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound of $\omega$ by showing that $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]]. With this, we will only consider moving sofas with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, and it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa has $\omega = 90^\circ$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with a movement of rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$. ^con-angle

> __Remark [angle].__ A single shape $S$ may admit different moving sofa movements in $L$ with varying rotation angles $\omega$. For any moving sofa $S$ mentioned in this paper, we will always assume a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ attached to it. So any moving sofa $S$ in this paper is technically a tuple of a shape and its fixed rotation angle. In this way, we can talk about _the_ rotation angle of a moving sofa. ^rem-angle

Both bounds in [[01. Moving sofa problem#^eqn-best-bounds]] are based on an important observation of Gerver in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. Take any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. He looked at the hallway $L$ from the perspective of the moving sofa $S$ in movement, so that the sofa $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ moves around the sofa (see [[01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). From this observation, we can see that the sofa $S$ is aways a subset of the following sets. Let $R_t$ be the rotation map of $\mathbb{R}^2$ along the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $t$.
1. Horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, because $S$ is contained in $L_H$ initially.
2. A translation of $R_\omega(V)$, the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$. At the end of the movement, $S$ is contained in the vertical side $L_V$ rotated clockwise by $\omega$; now observe this in perspective of $S$.
3. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, some translation $L_t$ of the hallway $R_t(L)$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$. The sofa $S$ is rotated initially by $0$ and finally by $\omega$. By the intermediate value theorem on the rotation of sofa in movement, a copy of $S$ rotated clockwise by $t \in [0, \omega]$ is contained in $L$. Now observe this in perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$.

Gerver pushed the idea further and proved the followings for a maximum-area sofa $S$ as well.
- By translating $S$ without loss of generality, we can assume that $S$ is the intersection of $H$, $R_\omega(V)$ and for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ the hallways $L_t$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.[^gerver-claim]
- We can also assume that 
hat if $S$ attains the maximum area,  In this paper, we call such moving sofas of maximum area which is the intersection of unit-width strips $H$, $R_\omega(V)$ and the rotating hallways $L_t$ a _monotone sofa_ (a precise definition is given in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]). Gerver's main observation in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] is now summarized as:

> __Theorem [monotone-sofa].__ There exists a monotone sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. ^thm-monotone-sofa

%% TODO: add the description that the monotone sofa is always bounded from below by line y=0 and above by line y=1 %%

> __Figure [monotone-sofa].__ The movement of a monotone sofa $S$ in perspective of the hallway (left) and the sofa (right). The monotone sofa $S$ is equal to the cap $K$ minus its niche $N$. The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as tangent lines of $K$ (and $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

Let $S$ be a monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$, so that $S$ is the intersection of $H$ and the hallways $L_t$ rotating counterclockwise by an angle of $t \in [0, \pi/2]$. For each $t$, the coordinate of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ of $L_t$ determines the location of $L_t$ completely. So the trajectory $\mathbf{x}_S : [0^\circ,90^\circ] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of the inner corner, defined as the _rotation path_ of $S$ by [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]], determines the monotone sofa $S$ which is the intersection of $H$ and $L_t$ completely. In particular, [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]] derived Gerver's sofa by solving the area optimality condition as a set of ordinary differential equations on $\mathbf{x}_S$. In this paper, we establish the following conditional upper bound on monotone sofas with injective rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S$.

> __Theorem [main].__ For any monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = 90^{\circ}$, if the rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S : [0^\circ, 90^\circ] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of $S$ is injective, and it is always on or above the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$, then the area of $S$ is at most $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. ^thm-main

The upper bound $2.2337\dots$ is conditional but much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\dots$ of Gerver than the currently best upper bound of $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Note that the rotation path $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}$ of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is also injective and always on or above the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$ ([[01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-gerver]]). So the bound of [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-main]] is effective on a domain containing the conjectured maximum $S_G$. We conjecture that a monotone sofa of maximum area satisfies the premise of [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-main]].

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ (Injectivity Hypothesis) There exists a monotone sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$, such that the rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S : [0^\circ, 90^\circ] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and always on or above the line $y = 0$. ^con-injectivity

So the bound in [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-main]] can be made unconditional if the angle and injectivity hypotheses are true.

Our main idea for proving [[01. Moving sofa problem#^thm-main]] is to overestimate the area of a monotone sofa $S$. Observe that the lower portion of the boundary of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ consists of two 'tails' and one 'core' (see [[01. Introduction/01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-gerver]]). The core forms the majority of the lower boundary, and it is the trajectory of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}(t)$ for $t \in [\varphi, \pi/2 - \varphi]$ with $\varphi = 0.0392\dots$ [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]]. The left and right tails are respectively the convex envelope of the inner left and right wall of the rotating hallways $L_t$ in contact with $S_G$.

by subtracting only the area bounded by the rotation path $x_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, ignoring the extra area taken away by the tails. As a result, the optimum of $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives a 'pre-sofa' $S_1$ which is not an actual moving sofa in the sense that a small portion at each ends of the inner corner extrudes out of the inner walls of $L$ during its movement.

> __Figure [presofa].__ The maximizing shape $S_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$ of area $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. The shape $S_1$ is not a moving sofa because the regions below two red curves stick out of the hallway $L$ during its movement (left). The shape $S_1$ is very similar to Gerver's sofa $S_G$ whose boundary is drawn in dotted lines (right). Cutting away the region under the red curves from $S_1$ gives a valid moving sofa of area approximately $2.2009\dots$. ^fig-presofa

[[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]] proves [[01. Introduction/01. Moving Sofa Problem#^thm-monotone-sofa]] stating that there exists a monotone sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$. Moreover, [[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]] shows that a monotone sofa is always equal to $K \setminus N$, where $K$ is a convex set we call a _cap_, and $N$ is a set we will call the _niche_ of cap $K$. We also show that the cap $K$ always contain the niche $N$. Using this, [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface]] reduces the moving sofa problem to the problem of maximizing the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ on the space of all possible caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. In particular, we observe that $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ forms a convex subset of a topological vector space. [[25. Upper bound A1/00. Preface]] proves the main [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^thm-main-cap]] by establishing the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$. We invoke _Mamikon's theorem_ to show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a concave quadratic functional on $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. Then we find the maximizer $S_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$ by introducing a calculus of variation on $\mathcal{A}_1$ based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies.

[[A1. Convex bodies/00. Preface]] proves numerous properties of an arbitrary planar convex body $K$ that we will use in this paper. So the logical ordering of this paper is [[01. Introduction/05. Notations and conventions]] followed by [[A1. Convex bodies/00. Preface]] and then the rest of the sections starting [[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]], which  logically inclined reader can follow. Readers who are interested in the overall idea, on the other hand, can read the sections in order and refer to the appendix occasionally when needed.

[^experiments]: Wagner used Monte Carlo simulation to find an approximate solution (Figure 2 of [[@wagner1976sofa]]) that resembles Gerver's sofa in shape. More recent approximate solutions, as found by Gibbs [[@gibbsComputationalStudySofas]] in 2014 and Batsch [[@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022]] in 2022, deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.

[^gerver-claim]: Gerver's proof in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] has a logical gap in assuming that the intersection of $H$ and the rotating hallways $L_t$ should be connected. In [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]], Kallus and Romik mitigated this issue by taking the largest connected component of the intersection. In this paper, we fill the gap by showing that for the _tangent hallways_ $L_t$ that Gerver took, the intersection is always connected ([[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]]).

%%
Both bounds in [[01. Moving sofa problem#^eqn-best-bounds]] are based on the observations of Gerver in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] that we sketch as follows. For the sake of explanation, we outline his ideas for the rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$, although his ideas generalize to every angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. He looked at the hallway $L$ from the perspective of the moving sofa $S$ in movement (see [[01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). In this perspective, a moving sofa $S$ with $\omega = \pi/2$ is always contained in the unit-width strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, and for every angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ some hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$.[^intermediate-angle] We can also assume that each $L_t$ containing $S$ always make contact with the sofa $S$ in the outer walls, by pushing each $L_t$ in the directions normal to the outer walls  towards $S$ while fixing $S$.[^hallway-pov] After doing so, the envelope of the outer walls of $L_t$ will form the upper portion of the boundary of $S$. Finally, Gerver observed that for a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ with $\omega = 90^\circ$, we can simply assume that $S$ is the intersection of $H$ and the rotating hallways $L_t$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.

[^hallway-pov]: In perspective of the hallway $L$, this is equivalent to translating the sofa $S$ rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$ towards the outer walls $x=1$ and $y=1$ of $L$.
