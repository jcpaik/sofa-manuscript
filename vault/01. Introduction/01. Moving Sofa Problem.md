Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 0] \times [-1, 0]$ and $L_V = [-1, 0] \times (-\infty, 0]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ could be defined as a planar subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The currently best known bounds on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as the following. ^best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gever's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ ([[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-gerver]]) constructed in 1994. Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, so that $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$. Computer experiments suggest numerically maximum-area sofas that look like Gerver's sofa, supporting his conjecture. On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] using computer assistance.

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa have the rotation angle $\omega = 90^{\circ}$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has rotation angle $\omega = 0^\circ$. If $\omega$ is the rotation angle of a moving sofa of maximum area, [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] showed that we can assume $\omega \in [60^\circ, 90^\circ]$, and [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] improved this by showing that $\omega \in [81.203\dots^\circ, 90^\circ]$ where the lower bound is $\arcsin(84/85)$. With this, it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa have the rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) A maximum-area moving sofa admits a movement of rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$. ^con-angle

Both the upper and lower bound of [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^best-bounds]] are based on the observation of Gerver that we sketch as follows (see Section 1 for a precise treatment). Assuming the rotation angle $\omega = 90^\circ$, he looked at the hallway $L$ from the perspective of the moving sofa $S$ in movement (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). In this perspective, a moving sofa $S$ is always contained in the unit-width strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [-1, 0]$, and for each angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, a hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$ (use the intermediate value theorem on the rotation of $S$ in movement). By pushing each $L_t$ towards $S$, we can also assume that the outer walls of $L_t$ always make contact with the sofa $S$, so that the envelope of the outer walls of $L_t$ is the upper portion of the boundary of $S$. Finally, Gerver observed that for a maximum-area $S$ we can simply let $S$ be the intersection of $H$ and $L_t$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.

In this paper, we will call such a moving sofa $S$ from Gerver's observation a _monotone sofa_. His observation tells us that a moving sofa of maximum area can be assumed to be monotone, and he used it to derive his sofa $S_G$ which is also monotone. For a monotone sofa $S$ with the hallways $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of $L_t$ completely determines the location of $L_t$. So the trajectory $\mathbf{x} : [0^\circ,90^\circ] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of the inner corner, defined as the _rotation path_ of $S$ by [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]], determines the monotone sofa $S$ as the intersection of $H$ and $L_t$ completely. [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]] derived Gerver's sofa by solving the area optimality condition in terms of ordinary differential equations on $\mathbf{x}$.

In this paper, we prove the following conditional upper bound on a large class of monotone sofas.

> __Theorem [main].__ For any monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = 90^{\circ}$, if the rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0^\circ, 90^\circ] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective, then the area of $S$ is at most $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. ^thm-main

The upper bound $2.2337\dots$ is conditional but much closer to the lower bound $\mu_G = 2.2195\dots$ of Gerver than the currently best upper bound of $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Also note that the rotation path $\mathbf{x}$ of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is injective, so that [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^thm-main]] is effective on a domain containing the conjectured maximum $S_G$. We conjecture that a monotone sofa of maximum area satisfies the premise of [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^thm-main]].

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ (Injectivity Hypothesis) A monotone sofa of maximum area always have injective rotation path $\mathbf{x} : [0^\circ, 90^\circ] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. ^con-injectivity

So the bound in [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^thm-main]] can be made unconditional if [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^con-injectivity]] is true.

Section 1 rigorously defines a monotone sofa and show that a moving sofa of maximum area can be assumed to be monotone. Moreover, it describe the structure of a monotone sofa $S$ by showing that $S$ is equal to $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$, where $K$ is some convex set called the _cap_ of $S$, and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a subset of $K$ called the _niche_ determined by the cap $K$ (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). We use the terminologies developed in Section 1 to state our main result and the injectivity hypothesis precisely in Section 2. In Section 3, we reduce the moving sofa problem to the maximization of the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$, on the space of caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ which is a convex space. We then construct a quadratic concave functional $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and show that the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$, by introducing a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies.
