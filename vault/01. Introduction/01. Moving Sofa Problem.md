In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following question, now known as the _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define a planar set $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ where $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ are the horizontal and vertical sides of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that can be moved from $L_H$ to $L_V$ by a continuous rigid motion inside $L$.

The largest known area of a moving sofa was improved over decades, until Gerver constructed in 1994 a moving sofa $S_G$ with the area $\mu_G = 2.2195\cdots$ which still holds the currently best record. Gerver conjectured that it has the maximum area possible.

Indeed, numerical experiments by Gibbs shows that polygonal sofas that assembles the shape of Gerver's sofa, suggesting that Gerver's conjecture is true. Gerver derived his sofa under . He essentially showed that a sofa of maximum area is the intersection of a continumm of hallways $L_t$ such that $L_t$ is rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$.  This idea is much more clarified in Romik's work using the rotation path $\mathbf{x}(t)$.

In this paper, we reduce Gerver's conjecture to a much weaker conjecture we call as the _injectivity hypothesis_. Note that the trajectory of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ does not self-intersect and is never below the bottom side of the sofa.  The injectivity hypothesis essentially states that a sofa of maximum area should 


We aim to prove the injectivity hypothesis in our future work using computer assistance. As of now,  Second, we reduce the proof of injectivity hypothesis to a set of inequalities verifiable of disputable by a finite number of computations. Finally,

It is known that a sofa of the maximum area $\mu_M$ exists [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. However, the exact value of $\mu_M$ is unknown. The work of Romik and Kallus [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] shows the best upper bound $2.37$ known so far using an extensive computer-assisted approach. With this, the best known bounds on the maximum sofa area are the following.
$$\mu_G = 2.2195 \dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37$$
By looking at the movement in the perspective of the sofa, one can see the sofa as essentially the intersection of _rotating hallways_ (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). Both Gerver's construction and Romik--Kallus's upper bound are based on this observation. The difficulty of finding the maximum sofa lies in the complexity of how the rotating hallways intersect. Gerver had to assume five specific stages of the sofa movement _a priori_ to derive his sofa ([[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-gerver-movement-stages]]). This assumption determines exactly which corners or sides of the hallway contribute directly to the area, allowing one to find an exact formula of the area that can be maximized (first using polygonal approximations by Gerver in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], and then simplified greatly by Romik using ODEs in  [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]]). Still, it is hard to prove that the hallways should intersect this way because the contact points of each hallway depends mutually on the positions of other hallways.

Note that Gerver's sofa consists of a convex set subtracted by the region carved out by the inner corner. In section 1, we define _monotone sofas_ as such a shape and show that a maximum area sofa is monotone.
In section 2,

Two well-known examples of a sofa are Hammersley's sofa [[@hammersley1968enfeeblement]] and Gerver's sofa [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] (see [[#^fig-sofa-examples]] and [[#^fig-gerver-sofa-movement]]). Hammersley's sofa has an area of $2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2.2074\cdots$ and it consists of two unit radius quarter-circles and a rectangular block of width $4/\pi$ carved out by a semicircular hole. On the other hand, Gerver's sofa has a slightly larger area of $\mu_G = 2.2195\cdots$. It has a complicated shape consisting of three straight line segments, four circular arcs, and eleven analytic curves. Gerver derived his sofa by considering local optimality and conjectured that it has the maximum area possible. His sofa currently holds the record of largest known area of a sofa. We refer to [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]] for the precise description of Gerver's sofa.

In Section 1, we provide rigorous definition of a sofa and introduce related concepts. Additionally, we state basic geometric results that will be utilized throughout the paper. The proofs of these results are included in Appendix A.

In Section 2, we introduce the notion of _monotonizing_ an arbitrary sofa $S$ that rotates clockwise by an angle of $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ while moving inside $L$. Take any sofa $S$, and push it towards the two outer walls of the hallway $L$ during its movement so that $S$ always touches the outer walls. Also, parametrize this movement by the angle $t$ of rotation of the sofa in movement ([[07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-hallway-intersection-is-sofa]]; see [[#^fig-monotone-movement]]).

The initial position $f_a(S)$ colored red is in the horizontal side $L_H$, and the final position $f_b(S)$ colored blue is in the vertical side $L_V$.

Then we look at the monotonized movement in perspective of the moving sofa. Now $S$ becomes stationary and the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ making an counterclockwise angle of $t$ touches $S$ in its outer walls. We define the _monotonization_ $\mathcal{M}(S)$ of $S$ as essentially the intersection of all rotating hallways $L_S(t)$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$ (plus minor modifications in details; see [[yy. Monotone Sofas#^def-monotonization]] for the exact definition). We show that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also a sofa and call such sofas of form $\mathcal{M}(S)$ as _monotone sofas_ ([[yy. Monotone Sofas#^thm-monotonization-is-hallway-intersection]]). As $\mathcal{M}(S)$ contains an arbitrary sofa $S$, we can assume that the sofa with maximum area is monotone.

We formally define a _cap_ $K$ with rotation angle $\omega$ as a type of convex body enclosed from above by a concave downward curve and from below by one or two line segments (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]] for a picture and [[yy. Monotone Sofas#^def-cap]] for the precise definition). We show that the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ with rotation angle $\omega$ is equal to the set difference $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$, where $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ is the _cap_ of $S$ in $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ ([[yy. Monotone Sofas#^thm-cap-hallway-intersection]]) with the outer walls of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ as upper tangent lines, and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is the _niche_ ([[yy. Monotone Sofas#^def-niche]]) determined by the cap $K$ which is the union of the regions swept by the inner walls and corner of the rotating hallway.

We show that the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is always a subset of the cap $K$ ([[yy. Monotone Sofas#^thm-niche-in-cap]]), so the area $\mathcal{A}(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ of the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(K)$ becomes a function of the cap $K$. Thus, the problem of maximizing the sofa area becomes the maximization of the area functional $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ ([[03. Space of Caps#^def-area-functional]]) on the space of all caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. It turns out that the space $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ is itself a convex space with the convex combination $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2 \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ defined using the Minkownski sum for any $K_1, K_2 \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ and $\lambda \in [0, 1]$ ([[03. Space of Caps#^thm-cap-mixin]]). So the domain of $\mathcal{A}$ is a convex space, and although we expect $\mathcal{A}$ itself to be not convex, we use this to construct a convex upper bound in the next section.

The main challenge of analyzing the sofa area $\mathcal{A}(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}(K)|$ is to understand the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$. In Section 3, we circumvent this difficulty by proposing the _injectivity hypothesis_ ([[05. Definition of A1#^con-injectivity]]), a mathematical statement we aim to prove in an upcoming work. The hypothesis essentially states that there is a monotone sofa $S$ attaining the maximum area such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ is injective (see [[05. Definition of A1#^con-injectivity]] for the precise statement). Assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we construct an effective upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ of the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$. The idea is that if the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K$ is injective, the region bounded by the trajectory of $\mathbf{x}_K$ is guaranteed to be a subset of the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$. The upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ is simply defined as the area of cap $K$ subtracted by the area $I(\mathbf{x}_K)$ of the region bounded by $\mathbf{x}_K$ ([[05. Definition of A1#^def-a1]]). This way, $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ only considers the effect of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K$ in the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$. For example, the value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ of Hammersley's sofa matches the area of the sofa because the niche is formed purely by the inner corner of the hallway. On the other hand, the value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ of Gerver's sofa is slightly larger than the area of sofa by the trimmed ends of the niche. We show that the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ of the area $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ is concave on the cap space $\mathcal{K}$ using Mamikon's theorem ([[15. Concavity#^thm-a1-negative-semidefinite]]). Then we use calculus of variation to find a local maximum $K_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$, which is in turn a global maximum because $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave. The area of $K_1$ is $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$, giving the upper bound of area $\mathcal{A}$ under the assumption of injectivity hypothesis.

This paper is a part of an ongoing attempt to prove Gerver's conjecture that Gerver's sofa indeed attains the maximum area. Our main observation in this paper is that most of the area carved out by the inner walls of the rotating hallway is the region enclosed by the trajectory of the inner corner (blue point in [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-gerver-movement-stages]]). We first show that there is a sofa of maximum area consisting of a _cap_ $K$, the convex set bounded from above by outer walls of the rotating hallway and bounded from below by the $x$-axis, subtracted by the _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ which is the region swept by the inner walls ([[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). Then we state the _injectivity hypothesis_ essentially saying that for such a maximum sofa, the trajectory of the inner corner does not self-intersect. Assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we observe that the region $\mathcal{N}_0(K)$ bounded by the inner corner is inside the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$, and define the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ of the sofa area as the area of the cap subtracted by the area of $\mathcal{N}_0(K)$, accounting only the effect of the inner corner. We show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a concave function with respect to the cap $K$ using Mamikon's theorem [[@mnatsakanianAnnularRingsEqual1997]] [[@apostol2000visual]]. By solving the convex optimization problem of $\mathcal{A}_1$, we obtain an upper bound $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$ of the sofa area much closer to the area of the Gerver's sofa than the previous upper bound of $2.37$ in [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]]. As this upper bound depends on the injectivity hypothesis, we plan to provide a computer-assisted proof of the injectivity hypothesis in an upcoming manuscript.
