Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a planar shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 0] \times [-1, 0]$ and $L_V = [-1, 0] \times (-\infty, 0]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ could be defined as a planar subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The currently best known bounds on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as the following. ^best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gever's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ ([[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-gerver]]) constructed in 1994. Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, so that $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$. Computer experiments suggest maximum-area sofas that looks like Gerver's sofa, supporting Gerver's conjecture. On the other hand, the upper bound was proved by Kallus and Romik [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] using computer assistance.

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa have the rotation angle $\omega = 90^{\circ}$. Let $\omega$ be the rotation angle of an arbitrary sofa of maximum area. [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] showed that we can assume $\omega \in [60^\circ, 90^\circ]$, and [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] improved this by showing that $\omega = [81.203^\circ, 90^\circ]$ where the lower bound is $\arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^{\circ}$. With this, it seems reasonable to conjecture that $\omega = 90^\circ$ for a maximum-area moving sofa.

Both the upper and lower bound of [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^best-bounds]] are based on the following observation of Gerver. He looked at the hallway $L$ from the perspective of the moving sofa $S$. In this way, a moving sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega = 90^{\circ}$ can be assumed to be the intersection of a unit-width strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [-1, 0]$ and a continuum of hallways $L_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$ (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). The inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of $L_t$ determines the location of $L_t$, so the trajectory

In this paper, we prove a conditional upper bound $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2338\dots$ on a large class of moving sofas, which is much closer to the lower bound $\mu_G = 2.2195\dots$ of Gerver compared to the upper bound of $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik.

In Section 1, we define _monotone sofas_ as a special subset of moving sofas, and show that there is a sofa with maximum area which is monotone. We show that a monotone sofa $S$ is always equal to $K \setminus \mathcal{N}(K)$ where $K$ a convex set called the _cap_, and $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a subset of $K$ called the _niche_ determined by the cap $K$ (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). With this, we reduce the moving sofa problem to the maximization of the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A}(K) = |K| - \mathcal{N}(K)$ on the space of caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ which forms a convex space. In Section 2, we precisely state the injectivity hypothesis. In Section 3, we construct a concave functional $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and show that the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$.
