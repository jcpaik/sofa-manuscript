We set up basic notions and conventions that will be used thoroughout the rest of the document.

# Moving Sofa

> __Definition [hallway].__ The _hallway_ $L = L_H \cup L_V$ is the union of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 0] \times [-1, 0]$ and $L_V = [-1, 0] \times (-\infty, 0]$, each representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. ^def-hallway

In the introduction, we gave a definition of a moving sofa $S$ as a subset of $L_V$. However, the condition $S \subseteq L_V$ is too restrictive for our future use, and we will also call any translation of such $S$ as a _moving sofa_ as well without loss of generality. It is safe assume that a moving sofa is always closed, since for any subset of $L$ its closure is also contained in $L$.

> __Definition [sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, such that a translation of $S$ is a subset of $L_H$ that admits a continuous rigid motion inside $L$ from $L_H$ to $L_V$. ^def-sofa

We also define the rotation angle $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ Say that a moving sofa $S$ have the _rotation angle_ $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ if the continuous rigid motion of a translate of $S$ from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$ rotates the body clockwise by $\omega$ in its full movement. ^def-rotation-angle

With the result of [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] that $\omega \in [81.203\dots^\circ, 90^\circ]$ for a maximum-area moving sofa, we will always assume that a moving sofa have $\omega \in (0^\circ, 90^\circ]$.

# Basic Notations

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure and interior as $\overline{X}$ and $X^\circ$ respectively. For a subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a vector $v$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, define the set $X + v = \left\{ x + v : x \in X \right\}$. For any two subsets $X, Y$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, the set $X + Y = \left\{ x + y : x \in X, y \in Y \right\}$ is the Minkowski sum of $X$ and $Y$.

We use the convention $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R} / 2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any function $f$ on $S^1$ and any $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we define $f(t)$ as the value $f(t + 2 \pi \mathbb{Z})$. That is, a real value coerces to a value in $S^1$ when used as an argument of a function that takes a value in $S^1$. We denote an interval of $S^1$ by its lift in $\mathbb{R}$. More precisely, for any $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_2 \in (t_1, t_1 + 2\pi]$, the intervals $(t_1, t_2]$ and $[t_1, t_2)$ of $\mathbb{R}$ are also used to denote the corresponding intervals of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$. Likewise, for any $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_2 \in [t_1, t_1 + 2\pi)$, the interval $[t_1, t_2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is used to denote the corresponding interval of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$.

For any function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ or $f : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(t-)$ denotes the left limit of $f$ at $t$ and $f(t+)$ denotes the right limit of $f$ at $t$. For any function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on some open subset $X$ of either $\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$, and $t \in X$, define $\partial^+f(t)$ and $\partial^-f(t)$ as the right and left differentiation of $f$ at $t$ if they exists.

We denote the integral of a measurable function $f$ with respect to a measure $\mu$ on a set $X$ as either $\int_{x \in X} f(x) \, \mu(dx)$ or $\left< f, \mu \right>_X$. The latter notation is used especially when we want to emphasize that the integral is bi-linear with respect to both $f$ and $\mu$.

# Convex Body

We define tangent lines and corresponding half-planes of an arbitrary nonempty and compact $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ as the following.

> __Definition [shape].__ A _shape_ $S$ is a nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-shape

> __Definition [frame].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$. ^def-frame

> __Definition [support-function].__ For any shape $S$, define its _support function_ $p_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $p_S(t) = \sup \left\{ p \cdot u_t : p \in S \right\}$. ^def-support-function

> __Definition [line].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$, and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the line $l(t, h)$ with the _normal angle_ $t$ and the distance $h$ from the origin as the following. ^def-line
$$
l(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h \right\}
$$

> __Definition [tangent-line].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent line_ $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $l_S(t) = l(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-line

> __Definition [half-plane].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$, and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the half-plane $H(t, h)$ with the boundary $l(t, h)$ as the following. We say that the half-plane $H(t, h)$ has the _normal angle_ $t$. ^def-half-plane
$$
H(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h \right\}
$$

> __Definition [tangent-half-plane].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent half-plane_ $H_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $H_S(t) = H(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-half-plane

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ [^We follow page 8 of Schneider for this definition. Note that the other authors often also include the condition that $K^\circ$ is nonempty.]. ^def-convex-body

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, define the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ as the intersection of $K$ with the tangent line $l_K(t)$. Let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the line segment $e_K(t)$ such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned farthest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned farthest in the opposite direction of $v_t$. ^def-convex-body-edge

It is possible that the edge $e_K(t)$ can be a single point. In such case, the tangent line $l_K(t)$ touches $K$ at the single point $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t)$.
