The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is defined as the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa has the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Let $\omega$ be the rotation angle of a maximum-area moving sofa. Gerver proved that we can assume $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]. Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound of $\omega$ by showing that $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. With this, we will only consider moving sofas with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, and it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa has $\omega = \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with a movement of rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Remark [angle].__ A single moving sofa $S$ may admit different movements with varying rotation angles $\omega$. For any moving sofa $S$ mentioned in this paper, we will always assume a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ attached to it. So any moving sofa in this paper is technically a tuple of a shape and its fixed rotation angle. In this way, we can talk about _the_ rotation angle of a moving sofa. ^rem-angle

Once we fix the rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ of a moving sofa $S$, we can change the moving sofa problem as the moving _hallway_ problem. In [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], Gerver looked at the hallway $L$ in the perspective of the moving sofa $S$, so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ moves around the sofa (see [[#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). In this perspective, we claim that the sofa $S$ is a common subset of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the rotated hallway $L_t$, which is the hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ are in contact with $S$.
2. The horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
3. A translation of $V_\omega$, where $V_\omega$ is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ around the origin.

To observe (1) that $S \subseteq L_t$ for every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, note that the sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its movement. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$. Push the rotated copy of $S$ in $L$ towards the positive $x$ and $y$ directions, until it makes contact with the outer walls $x=1$ and $y=1$ of $L$. See this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$. To observe (2) and (3), note that the sofa $S$ is initialy in $L_H$ and finally in $L_H$ rotated clockwise by $\omega$; see the configurations in perspective of $S$ ot conclude that $S$ is in $H$ and a translation of $V_\omega$.

The monotone sofa $S$ is equal to the cap $K$ minus its niche $N$. The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as the tangent lines of cap $K$ (and sofa $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded from above by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

Without loss of generality, we can translate the moving sofa $S$ horizontally and assume that $S$ is contained in $V_\omega$, not its arbitrary translation.[^translation] Then from (1), (2) and (3) above, we can always assume that $S$ is contained in the intersection ^eqn-monotone
$$
\mathcal{M}(S) := H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_t
$$
that we will define as the _monotonization_ of a moving sofa $S$. The set $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is also movable inside $L$; observe that $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is in each rotating hallway $L_t$ of angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, and see this in the perspective of the fixed hallway $L$ instead of the moving hallway $L_t$ and vary $t$ from $0$ to $\omega$. So the monotonization $\mathcal{M}(S)$ is a moving sofa containing $S$ ([[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-sofa]])[^connectedness], and we call such a sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$ from monotonization a _monotone sofa_ ([[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]). Since any moving sofa $S$ is contained in a larger monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(S)$, we only need to consider monotone sofas for the moving sofa problem.

The moving sofa problem can be seen as an _inverse Kakeya problem_ [@bae2021reverse; @cabelloInverseKakeyaProblem2022]. The original Kakeya problem asks for the minimum-area chamber $R$ in which a needle $S$ of length 1 can be rotated the full $360\degree$, allowing the needle to translate in its movement [@kakeya1917some]. In an _inverse_ Kakeya problem, the shape of the chamber $R$ is fixed and we are asked to find the shape $S$ (the 'needle') of largest area that can rotate freely inside the chamber, also allowing translations in movement. For example, if the chamber is the strip $R = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ of unit width, and the shape $S$ has to rotate the full $360\degree$, the problem becomes the well-studied _isodiametric problem_ asking for the maximum-area planar shape with diameter at most 1.

The moving sofa problem, as an inverse Kakeya problem, has the hallway as the chamber $R = L$ and the moving sofa $S$ as the 'needle' inside $L$. The inverse Kakeya problem has been solved If the chamber $R$ is a planar convex set; it is a consequence of the Brunn-Minkowski theorem that the largest-area shape $S$ that can rotate the full $360\degree$ inside a convex chamber $R$ is the largest ball inscribed in $R$ [@cabelloInverseKakeyaProblem2022]. Since the hallway $L$ is non-convex, however, the same approach is not effective on the moving sofa problem.

As an inverse Kakeya problem, the angle $\omega$ dictates how much the moving sofa $S$ should rotate inside the hallway $L$.

[^rotation-angle]: As an inverse Kakeya problem, it may occur that smaller value of total rotation angle $\omega$ will lead to less movement of $S$ and thus a larger area of $S$. However, the extra constraints that $S$ has to move from horizontal side $L_H$ to vertical side $L_V$ penalizes the area of $S$ as $\omega$ gets smaller from $\pi/2$.

[^translation]: Translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. To resolve this, we relax the [[10. Notations and Conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] of a moving sofa $S$ in so that only some translation of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^connectedness]: This uses an implicit assumption that the intersection $\mathcal{M}(S)$ should be connected. Indeed, [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] assumes the connectedness of $\mathcal{M}(S)$ in its proof of Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] without further justification. We prove this assumption rigorously in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]].

[^monotonization-monotone]: In fact, that $S$ attains the maximum-area only guarantees that the gain $\mathcal{M}(S) \setminus S$ of monotonization is of measure zero. We show in [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a Monotone Sofa#^thm-monotonization-fixpoint]] that for any monotone sofa, we have $\mathcal{M}(S) = S$.
