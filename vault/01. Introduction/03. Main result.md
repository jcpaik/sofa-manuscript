Assume the maximum-area monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Then we can assume $S = \mathcal{M}(S)$ in [[01. Introduction/02. Moving hallway problem#^eqn-monotone]] as taking further monotonization does not increase the area.[^monotonization-monotone] For each angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, let $R_t : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ along the origin, and let $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ be the coordinate of the inner corner of the rotated hallway $L_t$. Then the hallway $L_t = R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}_S(t)$ rotated counterclockwise by angle $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ is determined by its inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$. So the parametrization $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of the inner corner with respect to angle $t$, defined as the _rotation path_ of $S$ in [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018], determines the monotone sofa
$$
S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}_S(t) \right) 
$$
completely. In particular, Romik in [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] derived Gerver's sofa $S = S_G$ by solving for the local optimality of area of $S$ as a set of ordinary differential equations on $\mathbf{x}_S$.[^gerver-derivation]

The _injectivity condition_ of $S$ essentially states that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ is injective with respect to angle $t$.

> __Definition [injectivity].__ (Injectivity condition) A monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ satisfies the _injectivity condition_, if its rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and never below the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$ nor the bottom line $x \cos \omega + y \sin \omega = 0$ of $V_\omega$.
> ^def-injectivity

In particular, Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is a monotone sofa satisfying the injectivity condition (note that the blue trajectory of $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}$ in [[01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-gerver]] is injective and never below the bottom line $y=0$). For any monotone sofa satisfying the injectivity condition, the following upper bound is established.

> __Theorem [main].__ (Main theorem) The area of any monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ satisfying the injectivity condition is at most $1 + \omega^2/2$. ^thm-main

So the upper bound of [[#^thm-main]] is effective on a domain of monotone sofas containing the conjectured optimum $S_G$. The upper bound $1 + \omega^2/2$ of [[#^thm-main]] maximizes at $\omega = \pi/2$ with the value $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$, which is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\dots$ of Gerver than the currently best upper bound of $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik ([[01. Introduction/02. Moving hallway problem#^eqn-best-bounds]]). We conjecture that a monotone sofa of maximum area should satisfy the premise of [[#^thm-main]].

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ (Injectivity hypothesis) There exists a monotone sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, satisfying the injectivity condition. ^con-injectivity

With [[#^thm-main]], proving [[#^con-injectivity]] will imply the unconditional upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 1 + \pi^2/2 = 2.2337\dots$.

The main idea for proving [[#^thm-main]] is to overestimate the area of a monotone sofa $S$. For the sake of explanation, fix the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. Observe that the lower boundary of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ consists of two red 'tails' and one blue 'core' in [[01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-gerver]]. The core is parametrized by the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}(t)$ for the interval $t \in [\varphi, \pi/2 - \varphi]$ with constant $\varphi = 0.0392\dots$ [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018], and forms the majority of the lower boundary. The region below the two tails, trimmed out by the inner left and right walls of $L_t$ respectively, constitutes only about $0.28 \%$ of the area $2.2195\dots$ of the whole sofa. Motivated by this, we define the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area $\mathcal{A}$ of a monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$ as: the area of the convex hull $K$ of $S$, that we call the _cap_ of $S$, subtracted by the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and the line $y=0$.

Another key idea for proving [[#^thm-main]] is to consider the area of $S$ as a function of the cap $K$. By doing so, we turn the problem to a quadratic optimization problem in convex analysis. In particular, the overestimated area $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ as a function of the cap $K$ turns out to be a _concave_ and _quadratic_ functional with respect to the cap $K$. To justify this, we first construct the space $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ of all possible caps $K$ with a fixed rotation angle $\omega$. The space $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ itself is a convex space equipped with convex combination $c_\lambda(K_1, K_2) = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$ defined by the Minkowski sum of convex bodies. Then the Brunn-Minkowski theory [[@schneider_2013]] is used to establish that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a quadratic functional on $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. We use Mamikon's theorem [@mnatsakanianAnnularRingsEqual1997], a theorem in classical geometry, to prove that $\mathcal{A}_1$ concave on $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. Finally, we introduce a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory to find a local optimum $K_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$. Since $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave, the local optimum $K_1$ is also a global optimum of $\mathcal{A}_1$, and [[#^thm-main]] is established by computing the maximum value $\mathcal{A}_1(K_1) = 1 + \omega^2/2$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$.

For the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$, the maximizer of $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives an unmovable sofa $S_1$ of area $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$ and width $\pi$ very close to the area of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ (see [[#^fig-presofa]]). The shape of $S_1$ is very close to $S_G$, and cutting away the region under the red curves from $S_1$ gives a valid moving sofa of area approximately $2.2009\dots$, which is again very close to $S_G$ in its shape and area. The boundary of $S_1$ consists of three line segments and three parametric curves. The right side of $S_1$ is parametrized by the curve $\gamma : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\gamma(0) = (1, 1)$ and $\gamma'(t) = t(\cos t, -\sin t)$, which ends at $\gamma(\pi/2) = (\pi/2, 0)$. The left side of $S_1$ is parametrized by the curve symmetric to $\gamma$ along the $y$-axis. The bottom middle part of $S_1$ is parametrized by the curve $\mathbf{x}_{S_1} : [0, \pi/2] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\mathbf{x}_{S_1}(0) = (\pi/2-1, 0)$ and
$$
\mathbf{x}_{S_1}'(t) = -t (\cos t, \sin t) + (\pi/2- t) (-\sin t, \cos t)
$$
which is symmetric along the $y$-axis. The endpoints of the three curves are connected by three horizontal line segments of length 1 or 2 to form the boundary of $S_1$.

[^monotonization-monotone]: In fact, that $S$ attains the maximum-area only guarantees that the gain $\mathcal{M}(S) \setminus S$ of monotonization is of measure zero. We show in [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^thm-monotonization-fixpoint]] that for any monotone sofa, we have $\mathcal{M}(S) = S$.
