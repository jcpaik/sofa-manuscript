(Note as of Nov. 4 2023: This is the introduction that we can write after all WIP chapters are complete. Even if we publish the paper as-is, I wish if there is any way write the paper that at least _alludes_ to the following future plan)

In this paper, we reduce Gerver's full conjecture to a much weaker statement we call as the _injectivity hypothesis_. The hypothesis states that there exists a moving sofa $S$ of maximum area such that the followings hold.
- $S$ rotates $90$ degrees clockwise as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$
- The trajectory $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of the inner corner does not self-intersect nor goes below the bottom side of the sofa.
Note that Gerver's sofa satisfies the two conditions above, so the injectivity hypothesis is immediately implied by Gerver's conjecture. Our main theorem shows that injectivity hypothesis also _implies_ the full Gerver's conjecture. We also show that if Gerver's conjecture is true _a priori_, then 

In Section 1, we define _monotone sofas_ as a special subset of monotone sofas, and show that there is a sofa with maximum area which is monotone. A monotone sofa always consists of a convex set called the _cap_ subtracted by its _niche_ (see [[01. Moving Sofa Problem#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). With this, we turn the moving sofa problem to maximizing the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on the space of caps. In Section 2, we state the full statement of the injectivity hypothesis. In Section 3, we construct a concave upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and show that the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. In Section 4, we utilize the first upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ to construct a finer second concave upper bound $\mathcal{A}_2$. We show that Gerver's sofa attains the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$, and
