# Moving Sofa Problem

Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994 [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). Gerver derived his sofa from local optimality considerations[^gerver-derivation] and conjectured $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$, that his sofa attains the maximum possible area ([[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-gerver]]). Approximate solutions found by computer experiments are consistent with his conjecture.[^experiments] On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using extensive computer assistance [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]].

In this paper, we prove that any moving sofa satisfying a certain property, named as the _injectivity condition_, has an area at most $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. This upper bound, while conditional, is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\dots$ of Gerver than the unconditional upper bound $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Since Gerver's sofa $S_G$ satisfies the injectivity condition, our conditional upper bound is effective on the domain containing the conjectured optimum $S_G$. The proof does not rely on any computer assistance, and introduces a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory on convex bodies which is a new approach in this problem. We also conjecture the _injectivity hypothesis_ that there is a maximum-area moving sofa satisfying the injectivity hypothesis. With our result, showing the injectivity hypothesis amounts to proving the unconditional upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. We show that any maximum-area sofa sufficiently close to Gerver's sofa in the Hausdorff distance should satisfy the injectivity condition, which is in favor of the injectivity hypothesis.

# Moving Hallway Problem

The moving sofa problem can be seen as an instance of the _inverse Kakeya problem_. The original Kakeya problem asks for the minimum-area chamber $R$ in which a needle $S$ of length 1 can be rotated the full $360\degree$, allowing the needle to translate in its movement. In an _inverse_ Kakeya problem, the shape of the chamber $R$ is fixed and we are asked to find the shape $S$ (the 'needle') of largest area that can rotate freely inside the chamber, also allowing translations in movement. For an example, if the chamber is the strip $R = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ of unit width, and the shape $S$ has to rotate the full $360\degree$, the problem becomes the well-studied _isodiametric problem_ asking for the maximum-area shape with diameter at most 1. If the chamber $R$ is a planar convex set, it is a consequence of the Brunn-Minkowski theorem that the largest-area shape $S$ that can rotate the full $360\degree$ inside $R$ is the largest ball inscribed in $R$. In the moving sofa problem as an inverse Kakeya problem, the hallway $L$ is the chamber and the moving sofa $S$ is the 'needle'.

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. As an inverse Kakeya problem, the rotation angle dictates how much the moving sofa $S$ should rotate inside the hallway $L$. Gerver's sofa has the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Let $\omega$ be the rotation angle of a maximum-area moving sofa. Gerver showed that we can assume $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$ ([[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]). Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound of $\omega$ by showing that $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]]. With this, we will only consider moving sofas with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, and it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa has $\omega = \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with a movement of rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Remark [angle].__ A single moving sofa $S$ may admit different movements with varying rotation angles $\omega$. For any moving sofa $S$ mentioned in this paper, we will always assume a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ attached to it. So any moving sofa in this paper is technically a tuple of a shape and its fixed rotation angle. In this way, we can talk about _the_ rotation angle of a moving sofa. ^rem-angle

Once we fix the rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ of a moving sofa $S$, we can see the moving sofa problem as the moving _hallway_ problem. Gerver looked at the hallway $L$ in the perspective of the moving sofa $S$, so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ moves around the sofa [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). In this perspective, the sofa $S$ is now a common subset of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the hallway $L_t$, which is $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ is in contact with $S$.
2. The horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
3. A translation of $V_\omega$, where $V_\omega$ is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ along the origin.

To observe (1) that $S \subseteq L_t$ for every $t \in [0, \omega]$, note that the sofa $S$ is rotated initially by a clockwise angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$ during its movement. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a moment where a copy of $S$ is rotated clockwise by $t$ inside $L$. Push that copy of $S$ in $L$ towards the positive $x$ and $y$ directions, until it makes contact with the outer walls $x=1$ and $y=1$ of $L$. Now see this configuration in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$. To observe (2) and (3), observe that the sofa $S$ is initialy in $L_H$ and finally in $L_H$ rotated clockwise by $\omega$; see the configurations in perspective of $S$ ot conclude that $S$ is in $H$ and a translation of $V_\omega$.

> __Figure [monotone-sofa].__ The movement of a moving sofa $S$ in perspective of the hallway (left) and the sofa (right). The monotone sofa $S$ is equal to the cap $K$ minus its niche $N$. The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as tangent lines of $K$ (and $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

Without loss of generality, we can translate the moving sofa $S$ horizontally to further assume that $S$ is contained in $V_\omega$, not its translation.[^translation] If $S$ attains the maximum area, we can also assume that $S$ is simply the intersection of the sets $H$, $V_\omega$, and $L_t$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$ containing $S$.[^connectedness] In this paper, we define such a moving sofa $S$ satisfying
$$
S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{0 \leq t \leq \omega} L_t
$$
as a _monotone sofa_ (see [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]] for a full definition). Gerver's main observation in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] summarizes to the following theorem.

> __Theorem [monotone-sofa].__ (Gerver) There exists a monotone sofa $S_{\max}$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. ^thm-monotone-sofa



# Main Result

Let $S$ be a monotone sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, so that $S$ is the intersection of $H$, $V_\omega$, and the hallways $L_t$ rotating counterclockwise by an angle of $t \in [0, \omega]$. For each $t \in [0, \omega]$, the coordinate of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ of $L_t$ determines the location of $L_t$. So the trajectory $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of the inner corner, defined as the _rotation path_ of $S$ in [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]], determines the monotone sofa $S$ completely. In particular, Romik derived Gerver's sofa $S_G$ by solving for the local optimality as a set of ordinary differential equations on $\mathbf{x}_S$ [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]].[^gerver-derivation]

In this paper, we introduce the following condition on monotone sofas.

> __Definition [injectivity].__ A monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ satisfies the _injectivity condition_, if its rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and never below the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$ nor the bottom line $x \cos \omega + y \sin \omega = 0$ of $V_\omega$.
> ^def-injectivity

In particular, Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is a monotone satisfying the injectivity condition. We establish the following upper bound on monotone sofas.

> __Theorem [main].__ The area of any monotone sofa $S$ satisfying the injectivity condition is at most $1 + \omega^2/2$. ^thm-main

So the upper bound of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] is effective on a domain containing the conjectured maximum $S_G$. The upper bound $1 + \omega^2/2$ of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] maximizes at $\omega = \pi/2$ with the value $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. This is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\dots$ of Gerver than the currently best upper bound of $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik ([[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^eqn-best-bounds]]).

We conjecture that a monotone sofa of maximum area should satisfy the premise of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]].

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ (Injectivity Hypothesis) There exists a monotone sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, satisfying the injectivity condition. ^con-injectivity

So the upper bound in [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] can be made unconditional if the injectivity hypotheses are true.

Our main idea for proving [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] is to overestimate the area of a monotone sofa $S$. For simpler explanation, assume the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ of $S$. Observe that the lower boundary of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ consists of two 'tails' and one 'core' (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The core is the trajectory of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}(t)$ for $t \in [\varphi, \pi/2 - \varphi]$ with $\varphi = 0.0392\dots$ [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]] and forms the majority of the lower boundary. The region below the two tails, trimmed out by the inner walls of $L_t$, constitutes only $0.28 \%$ of the area $|S_G| = 2.2195\dots$ of the whole sofa. Inspired by this, we define the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area $\mathcal{A}$ of a monotone sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ as: the area of the convex hull $K$ of $S$ (that we call the _cap_ of $S$), subtracted by the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and the line $y=0$.[^a1-arbitrary-angle]

Maximizing the area $\mathcal{A}$ of a monotone sofa $S$ hard, because there is no managable formula of $\mathcal{A}$ that works for all possible shapes of $S$. On the other hand, the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$ has a definite formula with respect to the cap $K$ of $S$. Moreover, it turns out that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a _concave quadratic functional_ on a convex domain $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ of convex bodies $K$. So the maximization of $\mathcal{A}_1$ becomes a single quadratic programming on the domain $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. We use the Brunn-Minkowski theory [[@schneider_2013]] on convex bodies to establish that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is quadratic on $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. Then we use Mamikon's theorem [[@mnatsakanianAnnularRingsEqual1997]], a theorem in classical geometry, to prove that $\mathcal{A}_1$ concave on $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. Then we introduce a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory to find a local optimum $S_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$, which is a global optimum since $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave.

For the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$, the maximizer of $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives an unmovable sofa $S_1$ of area $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$ very close to the area of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-presofa]]). The shape of $S_1$ is very close to $S_G$, and cutting away the region under the red curves from $S_1$ gives a valid moving sofa of area approximately $2.2009\dots$, which is again very close to the area of $S_G$.

The regions below two tails (red curves) stick out of the hallway $L$ during the movement of $S_1$ in $L$ (left). The shape $S_1$ is very similar to Gerver's sofa $S_G$ whose boundary is drawn in dotted lines (right). ^fig-presofa

# Outline of the Paper

[[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface]] contains basic definitions that will be used thoroughout this paper.

[[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]] proves [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-monotone-sofa]] that there exists a monotone sofa with the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$. Using this, [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface]] reduces the moving sofa problem to the maximization of the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ on the space of all possible caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. [[25. Upper bound A1/00. Preface]] proves the main [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^thm-main-cap]] by establishing the upper bound $1 + \omega^2/2$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$ using the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$.

[[A1. Convex bodies/00. Preface]] proves numerous properties of an arbitrary planar convex body $K$ that we will use thoroughly in this paper. So the logical ordering of this paper is [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface]], followed by [[A1. Convex bodies/00. Preface]], then the sections starting [[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]]. A logically inclined reader may read in this ordering to verify the correctness of all arguments. Readers who are interested in the overall idea, on the other hand, may start by reading the sections in order and refer to the appendix when needed.

[^gerver-derivation]: In [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], Gerver had to assume five specific stages of sofa movement to derive his sofa $S_G$. While his sofa does follow the five stages, it is not proven why a moving sofa of maximum area should follow such stages _a priori_. Romik's derivation of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ in [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]] also relies on this assumption, so their derivations do not constitute a full proof of Gerver's conjecture $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$.

[^experiments]: Wagner used Monte Carlo simulation to find an approximate solution (Figure 2 of [[@wagner1976sofa]]) that resembles Gerver's sofa in shape. More recent approximate solutions, as found by Gibbs [[@gibbsComputationalStudySofas]] in 2014 and Batsch [[@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022]] in 2022, deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.

[^translation]: Technically, translating the moving sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial condition $S \subseteq L_H$. To overcome this, we relax the definition of a moving sofa $S$ in [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]] so that only a _translation_ of $S$ is required to be movable from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^connectedness]: This uses an implicit assumption that the intersection of $H$, $V_\omega$ and $L_t$ for all $t \in [0, \omega]$ should be connected. Indeed, Gerver in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] assumed this in his proof of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-monotone-sofa]] without any proof. We fill this gap in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]].

[^a1-arbitrary-angle]: For arbitrary rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ of monotone sofa $S$, the cap $K$ of $S$ is the convex hull of $S \cup \left\{ (0, 0) \right\}$. The overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area of $S$ is $|K|$ minus the area enclosed by rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S$, the bottom line $y=0$ of $H$, and the bottom line $x \cos \omega + y \sin \omega = 0$ of $V_\omega$.
