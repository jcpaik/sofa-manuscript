# Moving Sofa Problem

Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ ([[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]) constructed in 1994. Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, so that $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$, and approximate solutions found by computer experiments are consistent with his conjecture.[^experiments] On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] using computer assistance.

# Rotation Angle

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa has the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Let $\omega$ is the rotation angle of a moving sofa of maximum area. Gerver showed in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] that we can assume $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$. Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound of $\omega$ by showing that $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]]. With this, we will only consider moving sofas with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, and it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa has $\omega = \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with a movement of rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Remark [angle].__ A single shape $S$ may admit different moving sofa movements in $L$ with varying rotation angles $\omega$. For any moving sofa $S$ mentioned in this paper, we will always assume a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ attached to it. So any moving sofa $S$ in this paper is technically a tuple of a shape and its fixed rotation angle. In this way, we can talk about _the_ rotation angle of a moving sofa. ^rem-angle

# Monotone Sofas

Both bounds in [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^eqn-best-bounds]] are based on an important observation of Gerver in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. Take any moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. He looked at the hallway $L$ from the perspective of the moving sofa $S$ in movement, so that the sofa $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ moves around the sofa (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). From this observation, we can see that $S$ is aways a subset of the following sets. Let $R_t$ be the rotation map of $\mathbb{R}^2$ along the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $t$.

1. Horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, because $S$ is contained in $L_H$ initially.
2. A translation of $R_\omega(V)$. That is, the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$.
	- At the end of the movement, $S$ is contained in the vertical side $L_V$ rotated clockwise by $\omega$; now observe this in perspective of $S$.
3. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, some translation $L_t$ of $R_t(L)$. That is, a copy of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated.
	- The sofa $S$ rotates initially by an angle of $0$ and finally by $\omega$. By the intermediate value theorem, a copy of $S$ must be rotated clockwise by $t \in [0, \omega]$ in $L$ during its movement. Now observe this in the perspective of $S$ to conclude $S \subseteq L_t$.

Gerver pushed his idea further and showed the followings for a maximum-area sofa $S$ as well (again, see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-monotone-sofa]]).

1. Translating $S$ without loss of generality,[^translation] we can assume that $S$ is the intersection of $H$, $R_\omega(V)$, and for every $t \in [0, \pi/2]$ some translation $L_t$ of $R_t(L)$.
2. We can also assume that the rotating hallways $L_t$ containing $S$ are the _tangent hallways_ of $S$ making contact with $S$ at its outer walls.

In this paper, we rigorously define such a moving sofa $S$ satisfying all the conditions above as a _monotone sofa_ ([[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotone-sofa]]). Gerver's main observation [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] then summarizes to:

> __Theorem [monotone-sofa].__ There exists a monotone sofa of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. ^thm-monotone-sofa

Gerver derived his sofa using [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-monotone-sofa]], so Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is also monotone. Gerver's proof of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-monotone-sofa]], however, has a logical gap in implicitly assuming that the intersection of $H$, $R_\omega(V)$ and the tangent hallways $L_t$ should be connected. In this paper, we fill this gap in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^thm-monotonization-is-connected]].

# Main Theorem

Let $S$ be a monotone sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, so that $S$ is the intersection of $H$, $R_\omega(V)$, and the hallways $L_t$ rotating counterclockwise by an angle of $t \in [0, \omega]$. For every $t \in [0, \omega]$, the coordinate of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ of $L_t$ determines the location of $L_t$ completely. So the trajectory $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of the inner corner, defined as the _rotation path_ of $S$ by [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]], determines the monotone sofa $S$. In particular, [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]] derived Gerver's sofa $S_G$ by solving optimality conditions as a set of ordinary differential equations on $\mathbf{x}_S$.

In this paper, we establish the following conditional upper bound on monotone sofas.

> __Theorem [main].__ Let $S$ be a monotone sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Assume that the rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of $S$ is injective, and it is never below the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$ nor the bottom line $x \cos \omega + y \sin \omega = 0$ of $R_\omega(V)$. Then the area of $S$ is at most $1 + \omega^2/2$. ^thm-main

The upper bound $1 + \omega^2/2$ of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] maximizes at $\omega = \pi/2$ with the value $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. This is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\dots$ of Gerver than the currently best upper bound of $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik ([[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^eqn-best-bounds]]). Note that Gerver's sofa also satisfies the condition of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]); the rotation path $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}$ of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ is injective, and always on or above the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$. So the upper bound of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] is effective on a domain containing the conjectured maximum $S_G$.

We conjecture that a monotone sofa of maximum area should satisfy the premise of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]].

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ (Injectivity Hypothesis) There exists a monotone sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, such that the rotation path $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective and never below the bottom line $y = 0$ of $H$ nor the bottom line $x \cos \omega + y \sin \omega = 0$ of $R_\omega(V)$. ^con-injectivity

So the bound in [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] can be made unconditional if the angle and injectivity hypotheses are true.

Our main idea for proving [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] is to overestimate the area of a monotone sofa $S$. For explanation, consider the case $S = S_G$ and $\omega = \pi/2$. Observe that the lower portion of the boundary of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ consists of two 'tails' and one 'core' (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). The core, which is the trajectory of the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{S_G}(t)$ for $t \in [\varphi, \pi/2 - \varphi]$ with $\varphi = 0.0392\dots$, forms the majority of the lower boundary [[@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018]]. The region below the two tails, trimmed out by the inner walls of $L_t$, constitutes only $0.28 \%$ of the area $|S_G| = 2.2195\dots$ of the whole sofa.

Inspired by this, we define the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area $\mathcal{A}$ of a monotone sofa $S$ as: the area of the convex hull $K$ of $S$, subtracted by the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and the line $y=0$ (and an extra line $x \cos \omega + y \sin \omega = 0$ if $\omega < \pi/2$). The enclosing curve is a Jordan curve if the condition of [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-main]] is true. What makes the maximization of the area $\mathcal{A}$ hard is that there is no single formula of $\mathcal{A}$ that works for all possible shapes of $S$.[^gerver-derivation] On the other hand, it turns out that the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$ has a definite formula with respect to $K$. Moreover, we show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a _quadratic functional_ on the whole domain $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ of convex bodies $K$. So the maximization of $\mathcal{A}_1$ becomes a quadratic programming. We will use _Mamikon's theorem_, a theorem in classical geometry, to establish that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave as well. Then we introduce a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory [[@schneider_2013]] to find a local optimum $S_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$, which is a global optimum because $\mathcal{A}_1$ is concave.

For the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$, the maximizer of $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives a 'pre-sofa' $S_1$ of area $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$ (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-presofa]]) very close to the area of $S_G$. The set $S_1$ is not an moving sofa, as small regions below the two tails extrudes out of the inner walls of $L$ during its movement. The shape of $S_1$ is very close to Gerver's sofa $S_G$. Cutting away the region under the red curves from $S_1$ gives a valid moving sofa of area approximately $2.2009\dots$, which is again very close to the area of $S_G$.

> __Figure [presofa].__ The maximizing shape $S_1$ of $\mathcal{A}_1$ of area $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. The regions below two tails (red curves) stick out of the hallway $L$ during the movement of $S_1$ in $L$ (left). The shape $S_1$ is very similar to Gerver's sofa $S_G$ whose boundary is drawn in dotted lines (right). ^fig-presofa

# Outline

[[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface]] contains necessary definitions for this paper.

[[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]] proves [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^thm-monotone-sofa]] that there exists a monotone sofa with the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$, and proves a structural theorem on monotone sofas. Using this, [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface]] reduces the moving sofa problem to the maximization of the _sofa area functional_ $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ on the space of all possible caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$. [[25. Upper bound A1/00. Preface]] proves the main [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^thm-main-cap]] by establishing the upper bound $1 + \omega^2/2$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$ using the overestimation $\mathcal{A}_1$.

[[A1. Convex bodies/00. Preface]] proves numerous properties of an arbitrary planar convex body $K$ that we will use thoroughly in this paper. So the logical ordering of this paper is [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface]], followed by [[A1. Convex bodies/00. Preface]], then the sections starting [[15. Monotone sofas/00. Preface]]. A logically inclined reader may read in this ordering to verify the correctness of all arguments. Readers who are interested in the overall idea, on the other hand, may start by reading the sections in order and refer to the appendix when needed.

[^experiments]: Wagner used Monte Carlo simulation to find an approximate solution (Figure 2 of [[@wagner1976sofa]]) that resembles Gerver's sofa in shape. More recent approximate solutions, as found by Gibbs [[@gibbsComputationalStudySofas]] in 2014 and Batsch [[@batschNumericalApproachAnalysing2022]] in 2022, deviate in area from Gerver's sofa by small margins of $1.7 \times 10^{-7}$ and $5.7 \times 10^{-9}$ respectively.

[^translation]: Technically, translating the sofa $S$ may invalidate the initial position $S \subseteq L_H$. To overcome this, we relax our definition of a moving sofa $S$ in [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-sofa]], so that a _translation_ of $S$ can move from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$.

[^gerver-derivation]: In particular, Gerver derived his sofa $S_G$ by assuming a specific shape derived from five stages of movement.
