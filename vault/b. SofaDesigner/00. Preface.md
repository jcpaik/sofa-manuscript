Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires a well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966 [@moser1966problem], is asked in a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation: 

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
\mu_G := 2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[#^fig-gerver]]), and it is conjectured $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ that his sofa attains the maximum area.

The ticks denote the endpoints of 18 analytic curves and segments constituting the boundary of $S_G$ (see [@romikDifferentialEquationsExact2018] for details). The lower portion of $S_G$ is made of two small 'tails' (depicted red) and one large 'core' (depicted blue). ^fig-gerver

On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. Approximate the moving sofa by a polygonal intersection $S_\Theta$ of the horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and copies of hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by each angle in a finite set $\Theta \subset (0, \pi/2)$ (see [[c. Upper Bound A1/01. Introduction/01. Moving sofa problem#^fig-polygon-sofa]]).[^polygon-sofa] The bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2 \sqrt{2} = 2.828\dots$ by Hammersley [@hammersley1968enfeeblement] is obtained by taking a single angle $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/4 \right\}$, and the bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ by Kallus and Romik [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018] is achieved by taking five specific angles $\Theta$ and estimating the area of $S_\Theta$ from above with extensive computer assistance.

We suggest a computational framework based on branch-and-bound that effectively computes the configuration with maximum area or any lower threshold. We also implement `SofaDesigner`, a software implementing in the context of the moving sofa problem. has the following outcomes.

1. It proves the upper bound YY.
2. The software produces a certificate of the proof that can be checked independently of the framework itself.
3. More generally, the new method can bound any linear functionals on the polygonal sofas that attains the area at least.

The methodology used here is general enough to apply to Kakeya-type and inverse Kakeya-type problems involving polygons.
