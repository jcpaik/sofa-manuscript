Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a collection of polygons, either finite or infinite. The _Kakeya problem_ on $\mathcal{P}$ asks for the minimum-area union $\bigcup_{P \in \mathcal{P}} (P + \mathbf{x}_P)$ of the translates of $P \in \mathcal{P}$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}_P$. The _inverse Kakeya problem_ on $\mathcal{P}$ asks for the maximum-area intersection $\bigcap_{P \in \mathcal{P}} (P + \mathbf{x}_P)$.

The original Kakeya needle problem is recovered when $\mathcal{P}$ is 

Take any algorithm that computes the intersection of a collection of polygons, with the following property. (e.g. Weilerâ€“Atherton clipping algorithm)

1. Assume that any information on the position is accessed by linear inequalities on the coordinates of the positions. 
2. Along the way, it incrementally updates a polygon $Q$ containing the intersection.

To analyze all cases, each query can be turned into a branch instead. We can turn it into a decision tree.

The general principle is to divide a domain into smaller pieces by half. It's a complete tree. Each node with the set $S$ of inequalities have two leaf nodes $S \cup \left\{ I \right\}$ and $S \cup \left\{ I^c \right\}$. Every leaf node denotes a nonempty subset, or is degenerate with a proof of the set being empty. Or, an upper estimate of $Q$ which is 

The moving sofa problem is $\mathcal{P}$ is the maximum-area intersection problem on the infinite collection of $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and the rotating hallways $R_t(L)$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$. We use this general framework to the moving sofa problem, and use domain-specific knowledge on the moving sofa problem to effectively. It is known that a maximum-area sofa should be of the intersection of such kind, and the cap and niche part can be separate.
