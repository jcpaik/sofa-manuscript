# Moving sofa problem

Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994 [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, so that $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$ ([[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-gerver]]). Approximate solutions found by computer experiments are consistent with his [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-gerver]].[^experiments] On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using computer assistance [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]].

# Monotone sofa

A powerful idea described in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] is that a moving sofa is essentially the intersection of rotating _hallways_, if we look at the movement of $S$ inside $L$ in the perspective of $S$. Recall that a sofa of maximum area can be assumed to be a _monotone sofa_. A monotone sofa $S$ is always the intersection of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the hallway $L_t$, which is $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ is in contact with $S$.
2. Horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, because $S$ is contained in the horizontal way $L_H$ initially.
3. The set $V_\omega$, which is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ along the origin.

Gerver derived his sofa $S_G$ using the following process. First, instead of taking the intersection of all rotated hallways $L_t$ with angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, he took a finite subset $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$ and took the polygon intersection
$$
S_\Theta = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t) \right) .
$$
The approximated problem is now to maximize the area of $S_\Theta$ with respect to the coordinates $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for $t \in \Theta$.

Theorem 1 of [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] states that the polygon $S_\Theta$ is _balanced_. That is, for any angle $t \in S^1$, the sum $a_t$ of length of edges of $S_\Theta$ with normal vectors $u_t$ is equal to the sum $b_t$ of length of edges of $S_\Theta$ with normal vectors $-u_t$. 

However, such a process may break the connectedness of the intersection $S_\Theta$. Consider the example in Figure xx with $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/6, \pi/3 \right\}$. If we take the hallway $L_{\pi/6}$ and compare the right outer wall with right inner wall, it is that the right outer wall contributes the most. However, if we do push $\mathbf{x}(\pi/6)$ towards the direction of 

In this paper, we mitigate the issue by defining the _sofa area functional_ that separates the area contribution of the cap $K$ and its niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. 

On the way of proving [[b. Angle hypothesis/00. Preface#^thm-angle-cap]], we also show the following existence theorem of maxima of $\mathcal{A}_\omega$ satisfying certain properties.

> __Definition [niche-gap].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ be a cap with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. Define the following _niche gaps_ of $K$. ^def-niche-gap
$$
w_K^\circ = \inf_{0 < t < \omega} w_K(t) \qquad
z_K^\circ = \inf_{0 < t < \omega} z_K(t)
$$

> __Theorem [main-balanced-angled].__ Let $\omega \in (0, \pi/2)$ be arbitrary. There exists a maximizer $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ of the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}_{\omega}(K)$ such that $w_K^\circ \leq \beta_K\left( \pi/2 \right)$ and $z_K^\circ \leq \beta_K\left( \omega \right)$.
