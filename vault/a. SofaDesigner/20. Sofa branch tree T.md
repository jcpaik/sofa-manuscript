The frontline $\mathbf{p}$ represents the subset of niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ bounded from below by the line $y=0$ and bounded from above by the sequence of lines $l_{i_0}, l_{i_1}, \dots, l_{i_m}$ with the vertices $v(i_{j - 1}, i_{j})$ appearing from left to right. Condition 1 implies that the initial and final lines are equal to $l_0$, which is the line $y=0$. Condition 2 implies that the vertices $v(i_{j-1}. i_j)$ are well-defined for any $1 \leq j \leq m$. Condition 3 implies that any 'concave' turn from $l_{j - 1}$ to $l_j$ happens at the corner $v(i_{j-1}, i_j) = \mathbf{x}_{i_{j-1}}$ of hallway $L_{i_{j-1}}$. Condition 4 implies that
