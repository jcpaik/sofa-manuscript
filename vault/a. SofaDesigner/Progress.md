What should be the focus of this paper?
- (Hopefully) publish this at SoCG
- Open up an API that subsequent papers can access and handle without much difficulty



- [ ] Write introduction
	- [ ] Describe piecewise-quadratic polynomial upper bound
	- [ ] Show that we can compute each piece optimum by executing QP
	- [ ] Say that its real use is to prove linear inequalities on the cap space. Its real application will be to show the angle and injectivity hypothesis.
- [ ] Describe polygon upper bound
	- [ ] The coordinate system of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$
- [ ] Describe `sprove`
	- [ ] Say that the file formats are described in much detail in a github repository.
- [ ] Describe `sbranch`
	- [ ] So much details here...

Too angled -> gap bound is bounded below!
Less angled -> can just use pivot bound

This at least reduces computation number greatly.
If we can get it to no use of SofaDesigner at all, then it's a wonderful news.

Angle -> Works.

Assume inequality false. 
Then there is a extremely crude bound that works effectively in the situation.
