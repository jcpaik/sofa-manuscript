We observed that a moving sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ can be assumed to be the intersection of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ with inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$.
2. Horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
3. A translation of $V_\omega$, where $V_\omega$ is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ along the origin.

What makes the moving sofa problem hard was that the sofa area $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ with respect to the location $\mathbf{x} : [0, \pi/2] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ of hallways $L_t$ is _infinite-dimensional_, and there is also no definite formula of $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of $\mathbf{x}$.

Fix a finite number of angles 
$\Theta = \{0 < \theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_n < 90^\circ\}$
and take the intersection of $H$ and the hallways $L_t$ for $t \in \Theta$.

The area $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n)$ of the polygonal intersection is now a finite-dimensional upper bound of the area $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$.

Let $\Theta$ be a finite angle set. $\mathcal{A}_\Theta : \mathcal{K}_\Theta \to \mathbb{R}$ is a piecewise quadratic functional. 

The program understands the function completely.

In particular, it is capable of proving a linear inequality on $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$.
