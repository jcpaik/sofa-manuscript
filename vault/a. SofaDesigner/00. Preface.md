We observed that a moving sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ can be assumed to be a _monotone sofa_ which is the intersection of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the copy $L_t$ of hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ are in contact with $S$.
2. The horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
3. The copy $V_\omega$ of the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$ along the origin.

For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, denote the location of the inner corner of $L_t$ as $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$. Now the _rotation path_ $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of $S$ determines $L_t$ for every $t \in [0, \omega]$ and the monotone sofa $S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t$ completely. What makes the moving sofa problem hard was that the sofa area $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ of $S$ with respect to the rotation path $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_S$ is _infinite-dimensional_, and there is no managable formula of $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of $\mathbf{x}$ to optimize.

Kallus and Romik proved the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ of maximum sofa area. Their method was to compute the _polygonal upper bound_ $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$. Assume the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ of a monotone sofa $S$. Fix a finite number of angles 
$$\Theta = \{0 = \theta_0 < \theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_{n-1} < \theta_n = \pi/2\}$$
that forms a partition of the interval $[0, \pi/2]$. Define $S_\Theta$ as the intersection of $H$ and the finite number of hallways $L_t$ for $t \in \Theta$. Then $S_\Theta$ is a polygon, and the area $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n)$ of $S_\Theta$ is now a finite-dimensional upper bound of $\mathcal{A}$ depending solely on the positions $\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}(\theta_i)$ of hallways $L_{\theta_i}$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$. For the upper bound $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik, they used five angles.
