The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of the situation where we move a large couch through a narrow hallway:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ can be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994 [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. Gerver conjectured $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$, that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, but this remains unproven to this date. On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using computer assistance [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]].

Both bounds in [[#^eqn-best-bounds]] are based on an important observation of Gerver in [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]]. He looked at the hallway $L$ in the perspective of the moving sofa $S$, so that $S$ is fixed and the hallway $L$ moves around the sofa (see [[#^fig-monotone-sofa]]) while containing $S$. Using this idea, one can prove that there is a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ which rotates clockwise by an angle of $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ in its full movement, and that $S$ is the intersection of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the hallway $L_t$, which is $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ is in contact with $S$.
2. Horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, because $S$ is contained in the horizontal way $L_H$ initially.
3. A translation of $V_\omega$, where $V_\omega$ is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ along the origin.

The cap $K$ is a convex body with the outer walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$ as tangent lines of $K$ (and $S$). The niche $N$ is the union of all triangular regions bounded by the inner walls of $L_t = L_S(t)$. ^fig-monotone-sofa

Let $\mathbf{x}(t)$ be the location of the inner corner of the rotated hallway $L_t$. Then the maximum-area moving sofa $S$ is equal to the following set
$$
S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t
$$
and the problem becomes the maximization of the area of $S$ with respect to the coordinates $\mathbf{x}:[0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of inner corners $L_t$.

Kallus and Romik proved the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ by computing the _polygonal upper bound_ $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$. Assume the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ of a monotone sofa $S$. Fix a finite number of angles 
$$\Theta = \{0 = \theta_0 < \theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_{n} < \theta_{n+1} = \pi/2\}$$
that forms a partition of the interval $[0, \pi/2]$. Define $S_\Theta$ as the intersection of $H$ and the finite number of hallways $L_t$ for $t \in \Theta$. Then $S_\Theta$ is a polygon, and the area $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{n+1})$ of $S_\Theta$ is now a finite-dimensional upper bound of $\mathcal{A}$ depending solely on the positions $\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}(\theta_i)$ of hallways $L_{\theta_i}$ with $0 \leq i \leq n + 1$. Kallus and Romik used five nontrivial angles strictly between $0$ and $\pi/2$ to prove the upper bound $2.37$.

Notice that [[a. SofaDesigner/00. Preface#^thm-kallus-romik]] first overestimates $\mu_{\max}$ with the polygonal upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$, then overestimates $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ again to obtain the upper bound $2.37$. In this work, we present SofaDesigner, a framework for calculating the exact maximum of $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$.

The main observation is that the polygon upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ is a _piecewise quadratic polynomial_. Once the order of edges of the polygonal intersection $S_\Theta$ is determined (e.g. see the caption of [[a. SofaDesigner/00. Preface#^fig-polygon-sofa]]), its area $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ becomes a quadratic polynomial of the coordinates $\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{n+1}$. Each piece is a polytope constrained by linear inequalities that fixes the ordering of edges appearing as boundary of $S_\Theta$.



It consists of the following procedures.

- SofaBranch computes the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ precisely, and returns it in a form of complete binary tree $T_\Theta$.
- SofaProve takes a valid sofa tree $T_\Theta$ and attempts to prove the linear inequality $I$. If successful, the procedure produces a proof of 

Two procedures produce the proof in a file format. For example, the proof of [[#^thm-kallus-romik-exact]] 

No trust on SofaDesigner is required to verify the correctness of proof produced by the framework. Instead, a third-party verifier can verify the proofs produced by the procedures SofaBranch and SofaProve.

- VerifyTree can take any complete binary tree $T_\Theta$ and verify if $T_\Theta$ is indeed a valid branch-and-bound tree correctly representing an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_{T_\Theta}$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$.
- VerifyProof takes any valid branch-and-bound tree $T_\Theta$, the claimed inequality $I_\Theta$ and 

Using a total of eight angles, we can improve the upper bound further.

Simply enumerating all possible configurations will easily lead to combinatorial explosion. It is known that $S_\Theta$ is equal to its convex hull $K$ minus the _niche_ $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ determined by $K$ which is the union of triangles with base $y=0$ and vertex $\mathbf{x}_i$ ([[a. SofaDesigner/00. Preface#^fig-polygon-sofa]]). It is also guaranteed that the cap $K$ always consists of edges with normal angles in $\Theta$ in order. So it suffices for us to enumerate the possible of the union of triangles in the niche. The polygon upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$ is now expressible in terms of the convex polygon $K$. Still, this does not suffice to reduce the combinatorial explosion when more angles are needed.

To overcome this, we supply an algorithm $SofaBranch$ that computes the pieces and the polynomial $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ exactly with a branch-and-bound approach. The software will take the space $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ of all possible polygonal sofas and subdivide into smaller pieces. Each piece $\mathcal{K}_N$ is described by a finite set $N$ of linear constraints. Each piece $\mathcal{K}_N$ is subdivided using an inequality $I$ and its complement $I^c$ into $\mathcal{K}_{N \cup \left\{ I \right\}}$ and $\mathcal{K}_{N \cup \left\{ I^c \right\}}$ . As the pieces get refined, we keep track of a _polyline_ $\mathbf{p}$ which estimates the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ from below.

and is equipped with an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\mathbf{p}$ which is cruder than the polygon upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$. If the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\mathbf{p}$ is always less than Gerver's sofa area, then we can discard the piece $\mathcal{K}_N$ immediately. Otherwise, we canand improve the upper estimate further. The leaf nodes $\mathcal{K}_N$ and their corresponding upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\mathbf{p} : \mathcal{K}_N \to \mathbb{R}$ matches with the polygon upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$.

To find an upper bound of the maximum area $\mu_{\max}$, we can trasverse the leaf nodes $(N, \mathbf{p})$ and calculate the maximum value $\max \mathcal{A}_\mathbf{p}$. This is essentially a quadratic programming.[^Convexity of upper bound is not always guaranteed, so we check that manually] Moreover, `SofaDesigner` is capable of proving linear inequalities $I$ on the polygon sofa $\mathcal{S}_\Theta$. For each node $(N, \mathbf{p})$, if the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_\mathbf{p}$ constrained to $N \cup \left\{ I^c \right\}$ has maximum area strictly less than $\mu_{\max}$, then the inequality $I$ is true.

To ensure the mathematical correctness of the algorithm $SofaBranch$ and its implementation $\texttt{SofaDesigner}$, it uses quadratic programming with exact rational arithmetic. The correctness of each QP can be verified using the lambda certificates. Moreover, we describe a much simpler procedure $SofaVerify(\Theta, T)$ that verifies whether the tree $T$ gives a valid upper bound $\mathcal{A}_T$. We provide a full dump of the branch tree $T$ in text files. So one can independently verify the correctness of tree $T$ without having to trust the full $SofaBranch$ or its implementation $\texttt{SofaDesigner}$. The proof of inequality $I$ can be done using a similar method.

The procedure $SofaProve(\Theta, T, I)$ attempts to prove an inequality $I$ using method of contradiction. If it returns true, then the inequality $I$ is always true.[^On the other hand, the procedure returning false only means that it failed to prove the inequality I, which may or may not be true] The proof of $I$ produced by $SofaProve$ can also be verified independently of the SofaDesigner framework. This functionality of `SofaDesigner` will be used to prove a slight variant of [[a. SofaDesigner/00. Preface#^con-angle]], which will be the result of a subsequent work.

# Implementation

$\texttt{SofaDesigner}$ is an implementation of the procedures $SofaBranch$ and $SofaProve$.
