We observed that a moving sofa $S$ of maximum area with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ can be assumed to be a _monotone sofa_ which is the intersection of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the hallway $L_t$, which is $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ is in contact with $S$.
2. Horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$, because $S$ is contained in the horizontal way $L_H$ initially.
3. A translation of $V_\omega$, where $V_\omega$ is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ along the origin.

The _rotation path_ $\mathbf{x}_S : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of $S$ is defined so that $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ is the location of the inner corner of rotated hallway $L_t$. What makes the moving sofa problem hard was that the sofa area $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ of $S$ with respect to the rotation path $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_S$ is _infinite-dimensional_, and there is no managable formula of $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ in terms of $\mathbf{x}$ to optimize.

Kallus and Romik proved the following upper bound


They proved by computing the _polygonal upper bound_ $\mathcal{A}_\Theta$ of the sofa area $\mathcal{A}$. Assume the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$ of a monotone sofa $S$. Fix a finite number of angles 
$$\Theta = \{0 < \theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_n < \pi/2\}$$
that forms a partition of the interval $[0, \pi/2]$ and define $S_\Theta$ as the intersection of $H$ and the finite number of hallways $L_t$ for $t \in \Theta$. Then $S_\Theta$ is a polygon, and the area $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n)$ of $S_\Theta$ is now a finite-dimensional upper bound of $\mathcal{A}$ depending solely on the positions $\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}(\theta_i)$ of hallways $L_{\theta_i}$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$.
