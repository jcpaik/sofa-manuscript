The procedure $\mathsf{sbranch}(\Theta)$ takes the finite angle set $\Theta$ and returns the subset of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ with $\mathcal{A}_\Theta (K) \geq \mu_G$ in a tree form.

Fix a finite angle set $\Theta$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$. Let $K$ be an arbitrary member of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$. It often helps to denote a part of the sofa polygon simply by using index.

In this way, the niche of $S$ is bounded by a polyline forming. Also, the slope of $d_i$ increases by the index $i$, and is positive when $i > 0$ and negative when $i < 0$. Define the normal vectors $v_i$ of $d_i$ including the negative vectors.

The set $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ is a polytope.

So a sofa polytope $N$ denotes a subset of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ which is a polytope.

Let's make no distintion between a polytope $P$ and its list of inequalities.

A convex polytope $P$ of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ is described by inequalities attached to it. Say that a polytope $P \subseteq \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ _admits_ polyline $\mathbf{i} = i_0, \dots, i_m$ if it is guaranteed that the vertices $l_{i_k} \cap l_{i_{k+1}}$ are guaranteed to appear in the order from left to right. This is a bunch of linear inequalities and can be readily checked using linear programming. Then, we have the following lemma.

(TODO: change the following into a theorem format)

Consider any set $N$ of inequalities. We use an abuse of notation, so that $N$ also denotes the subset of $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ described by $N$.
