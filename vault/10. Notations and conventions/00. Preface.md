In this section, we set up basic notations, definitions and conventions that will be assumed thoroughout the rest of the document. We also gather the notions that will be defined later for easier reference. Definitions not listed in this section will be always referenced before its first use in a proof.

This section is not meant to be read in one setting. Instead, the reader may start by reading only the definitions related to moving sofas, shapes, and convex bodies and move on, referring to parts of this section later as needed.

# Notations

Denote the area (Borel measure) of a measurable $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ as $|X|$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the topological closure, boundary, and interior as $\overline{X}$, $\partial X$, and $X^\circ$ respectively.

For a subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a vector $v$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, define the set $X + v = \left\{ x + v : x \in X \right\}$. For any two subsets $X, Y$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, the set $X + Y = \left\{ x + y : x \in X, y \in Y \right\}$ denotes the Minkowski sum of $X$ and $Y$. For any subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a real value $a$, define the set $aX = \left\{ ax : a \in X \right\}$.

We use the convention $S^1 = \mathbb{R} / 2 \pi \mathbb{Z}$. For any function $f$ on $S^1$ and any $t \in \mathbb{R}$, the notation $f(t)$ denotes the value $f(t + 2 \pi \mathbb{Z})$. That is, a real value coerces to a value in $S^1$ when used as an argument of a function that takes a value in $S^1$. We will often denote an interval of $S^1$ by its lift under the canonical map $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} / 2 \pi \mathbb{Z} = S^1$. Specifically, for any $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_2 \in (t_1, t_1 + 2\pi]$, the intervals $(t_1, t_2]$ and $[t_1, t_2)$ of $\mathbb{R}$ are used to denote the corresponding intervals of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$. Likewise, for any $t_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t_2 \in [t_1, t_1 + 2\pi)$, the interval $[t_1, t_2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is used to denote the corresponding interval of $S^1$ mapped under $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$.

For any function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ or $f : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(t-)$ denotes the left limit of $f$ at $t$ and $f(t+)$ denotes the right limit of $f$ at $t$. For any function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on some open subset $X$ of either $\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$, and $t \in X$, define $\partial^+f(t)$ and $\partial^-f(t)$ as the right and left differentiation of $f$ at $t$ if they exists.

We denote the integral of a measurable function $f$ with respect to a measure $\mu$ on a set $X$ as either $\int_{x \in X} f(x) \, \mu(dx)$ or $\left< f, \mu \right>_X$. The latter notation is used especially when we want to emphasize that the integral is bi-linear with respect to both $f$ and $\mu$.

# Moving sofa

> __Definition [hallway].__ The _hallway_ $L = L_H \cup L_V$ is the union of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$, each representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [strip].__ Define the unit-width horizontal and vertical strips $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ respectively. ^def-strip

In the introduction, we gave a definition of a moving sofa $S$ as a subset of $L_H$. However, the condition that $S$ should be confined in $L_H$ is a bit restrictive for our future use. So we will also call any translation of such $S \subseteq L_H$ a _moving sofa_ as well without loss of generality.

> __Definition [sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, such that a translation of $S$ is a subset of $L_H$ that admits a continuous rigid motion inside $L$ from $L_H$ to $L_V$. ^def-sofa

It is safe assume that a moving sofa is always closed, since for any subset of $L$ its closure is also contained in $L$. We also define the rotation angle $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ Say that a moving sofa $S$ have the _rotation angle_ $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ if the continuous rigid motion of a translate of $S$ from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$ rotates the body clockwise by $\omega$ in its full movement. ^def-rotation-angle

With the result of [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] that $\omega \in [81.203\dots^\circ, 90^\circ]$ for a maximum-area moving sofa, we will always assume that a moving sofa have rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. For each rotation angle $\omega$, we define the following notions for future use.

> __Definition [parallelogram].__ For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, define the _parallelogram_ $P_\omega = H \cap R_\omega(V)$ with _rotation angle_ $\omega$.[^parallelogram] ^def-parallelogram

> __Definition [j-cap].__ For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, define the set $J_\omega = [0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]$. ^def-j-cap

For reference, the notion of _standard position_ will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-standard-position]]. The _monotonization_ $\mathcal{M}(S)$, _cap_ $\mathcal{C}(S)$, and _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ of a moving sofa $S$ will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotonization]], [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-cap-sofa]], and [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^def-niche]] respectively.

# Convex body $K$

> __Definition [shape].__ In this paper, a _shape_ $S$ is a nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-shape

> __Definition [frame].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$. ^def-frame

Any line on $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be described by the angle $t$ of its normal vector $u_t$ and its (signed) distance from the origin.

> __Definition [line].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the line $l(t, h)$ with the _normal angle_ $t$ and the signed distance $h$ from the origin as ^def-line
$$
l(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h \right\}.
$$

A line on $\mathbb{R}^2$ divids the plane into two half-planes. Following [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-line]], we also give a name to one of the half-planes in the direction of $-u_t$.

> __Definition [half-plane].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the closed _half-plane_ $H(t, h)$ with the boundary $l(t, h)$ as ^def-half-plane
$$
H(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h \right\}.
$$
> We say that the closed half-plane $H(t, h)$ has the _normal angle_ $t$.

Fix a shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$. Take a sufficiently large $h \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $H(t, h) \supseteq S$. As we decrease $h$ continuously, the line $l(t, h)$ will get close to $S$ until it makes contact with $S$ for the first time. We define the value of $h$, tangent line $l(t, h)$, tangent half-plane $H(t, h)$ as the following [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-support-function]], [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-tangent-line]] and [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-tangent-half-plane]].

> __Definition [support-function].__ For any shape $S$, define its _support function_ $p_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $p_S(t) = \sup \left\{ p \cdot u_t : p \in S \right\}$. ^def-support-function

> __Definition [tangent-line].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent line_ $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $l_S(t) = l(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-line

> __Definition [tangent-half-plane].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent half-plane_ $H_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $H_S(t) = H(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-half-plane

Observe that the support function $p_S(t)$ measures the signed distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the tangent line $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with the normal vector $u_t$ directing outwards from $S$. Support function and tangent lines of $S$ are usually studied when $S$ is a convex body (e.g. p45 of [[@schneider_2013]]), but in this paper we generalize the notion to arbitrary shape $S$.

The following notion of _width_ along a direction is also studied for convex bodies (e.g. p49 of [[@schneider_2013]]).

> __Definition [width].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, the _width_ of $S$ along the direction of unit vector $u_t$ is defined as $p_S(t) + p_S(t + \pi)$. ^def-width

Geometrically, the width of $S$ along $u_t$ measures the distance between the parallel tangent lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi)$ of $S$.

We adopt the following definition of a convex body (p8 of [[@schneider_2013]]).

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-convex-body

Many authors often also include the condition that $K^\circ$ is nonempty, but we allow $K^\circ$ to be empty (that is, $K$ can be a closed line segment or a point).

In this paper only, we use the following notions of _vertices_ and _edges_ of a planar convex body $K$.

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, define the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ as the intersection of $K$ with the tangent line $l_K(t)$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Definition [convex-body-vertex].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the edge $e_K(t)$ such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned farthest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned farthest in the opposite direction of $v_t$. We call $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ the _vertices_ of $K$. ^def-convex-body-vertex

It is possible that the edge $e_K(t)$ can be a single point. In such case, the tangent line $l_K(t)$ touches $K$ at the single point $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t)$. In fact, it turns out that this holds for every $t \in S^1$ except for a countable number of values of $t$.

# Cap $K$ and area functionals

For reference, the notion of cap $K$ as a type of convex bodies will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a monotone sofa#^def-cap]]. The space of all caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$ will be defined in [[20. Sofa area functional/00. Preface#^def-cap-space]]. The vertices $A_K^{\pm}(t)$, $C_K^{\pm}(t)$ of a cap $K$ is defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/15. Cap contains niche#^def-cap-vertices]]. The upper boundary $\delta K$ of a cap $K$ is defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/15. Cap contains niche#^def-upper-boundary-of-cap]]. The function $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is the _sofa area functional_ defined in. $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K}_\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is a conditional upper bound of $\mathcal{A}$ that is defined in .

Refer to [[@steinRealAnalysisMeasure2005]] for the standard notion of bounded variation and absolute continuity of a single-variable, real-valued function. Remark that a continuous curve with parametirzation $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is rectifiable if and only if its $x$ and $y$ coordinates are both of bounded variation.

> __Definition [planar-cross-product].__ For two points $(a, b), (c, d) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, denote their cross product as $(a, b) \times (c, d) = ad - bc \in \mathbb{R}$. ^def-planar-cross-product

> __Definition [curve-area-functional].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any curve equipped with a rectifiable parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. With $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, define the _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ of $\Gamma$ as the following. ^def-curve-area-functional
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t)
$$
> Also, write $\mathcal{I}(p, q)$ for the area functional of the line segment connecting point $p$ to $q$, so that we have $\mathcal{I}(p, q) = 1/2 \cdot (p \times q)$.

The integral in [[10. Notations and conventions/00. Preface#^def-curve-area-functional]] is the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.

# Parts of hallway $L$

We give names to the different parts of the hallway $L$ for future reference.

> __Definition [hallway-corners].__ Let $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ be the inner and outer corner of $L$ respectively. ^def-hallway-corners

> __Definition [hallway-walls].__ Let $a$ and $c$ be the lines $x=1$ and $y=1$ representing the _outer walls_ of $L$ passing through $\mathbf{y}$. Let $b$ and $d$ be the half-lines $(-\infty, 0] \times \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0 \right\} \times (-\infty, 0]$ representing the _inner walls_ of $L$ emanating from the inner corner $\mathbf{x}$. ^def-hallway-walls

> __Definition [hallway-regions].__ Let $Q^+ = (-\infty, 1]^2$ be the closed quarter-plane bounded by outer walls $a$ and $c$. Let $Q^- = (-\infty, 0)^2$ be the open quarter-plane bounded by inner walls $b$ and $d$, so that $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$. ^def-hallway-regions

For reference, the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t)$ of a shape $S$ will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-tangent-hallway]]. The corresponding parts $\mathbf{x}_S(t), \mathbf{y}_S(t), a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t), d_S(t), Q^+_S(t), Q^-_S(t)$ of the tangent hallway will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-rotating-hallway-parts]].

[^parallelogram]: If $\omega = \pi/2$, then the set $P_{\pi/2} = H$ is technically not a parallelogram. We will however call it as the parallelogram with rotation angle $\pi/2$.
