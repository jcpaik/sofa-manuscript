In this section, we set up basic notations, definitions and conventions that will be assumed thoroughout the rest of the document. We also gather the notions that will be defined later for easier reference. Definitions not listed in this section will be always referenced before its first use in a proof.

This section is comprehensive and not meant to be read in one setting. Instead, the reader may start by reading only the definitions related to moving sofas, shapes, and convex bodies and move on, referring to parts of this section later as needed.
