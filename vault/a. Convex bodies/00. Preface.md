This [[a. Convex bodies/00. Preface]] defines and proves numerous basic properties on a planar convex body $K$. In particular, we prove an equality relating the extreme points $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ of $K$ and the surface area measure $\sigma_K$ of $K$ ([[a. Convex bodies/10. Surface area measure#^thm-boundary-measure-differential]]). Also, we define convex curves $\mathbf{p}_K^I$ as parts of the boundary of $K$, and prove Mamikon's theorem on convex curves.
