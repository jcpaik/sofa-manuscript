Give the space of caps $\mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ the Hausdorff measure. Then near the cap $K_G$ of Gerver's sofa, the injectivity hypothesis holds.

> __Theorem [gerver-injectivity].__ There exists a $\epsilon>0$ such that, for every $K \in \mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ close to the cap $K_G$ under Hausdorff norm < $\epsilon$, if the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}(K)$ attains the maximum area then the cap $K_G$ is well-behaved. ^thm-gerver-injectivity

Because this theorem is irrelevant to the main result, we only give a brief sketch of the proof. But this also serves as a good blueprint to the actual proof of [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity-cap]].

_Proof._ (Incomplete)

- As $K \to K_G$, most of $g^+_K(t)$ and $h^+_K(t)$ converge to that of $K_G$, because the curvature at boundary of $K_G$ is bounded.
- Take $\delta$ sufficientlly small so that 0.01 neighborhood of $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ and $w_K(t)$ are strictly contained inside the niche $\mathcal{N}(K_G)$ of Gerver's sofa.
- The trouble occurs when $t$ is close to $0$ or $\pi/2$. For that you need to attach a bar above $K$. Even with bar attached,

Computer experimentations by Gibbs suggest that Gerver's sofa is the unique optimum of the moving sofa problem. If this was true _a priori_, we can show that the maximum of the sofa area functional should be  by running the program of Kallus-Romik for long enough.
