We now state the _injectivity hypothesis_ which is a much weaker version of Gerver's conjecture. Observe that the cap $K_G$ of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ satisfies the following properties.

> __Definition [well-behaved].__ For a cap $K$, say that it is _well-behaved_ if it satisfies the following conditions. ^def-well-behaved
> 
> 1. $S$ has rotation angle $90^{\circ}$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ is injective with respect to $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 3. For any $t \in (0, \omega)$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ is inside $F_{\pi/2}$.
> 4. The starting point $\mathbf{x}_K(0)$ of the arc is strictly on the right side of the ending point $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2)$ of the arc. That is, $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2) \cdot u_0 < \mathbf{x}_K(0) \cdot u_0$.

So the cap of Gerver's sofa is well-behaved. But also note that the condition is much more general and there will be much more monotone sofas with well-behaving caps. The injectivity hypothesis states that there exists a sofa of maximum area with a well-behaved cap.

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ There is a monotone sofa $S = S_{\text{max}}$ attaining the maximum area among all sofas, with a well-behaved cap. ^con-injectivity

Our main theorem is that we can recover the full Gerver's conjecture from injectivity hypothesis.
