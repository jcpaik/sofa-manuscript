We now state the _injectivity hypothesis_ in full details which is a much weaker version of Gerver's conjecture. Observe that the cap $K_G$ of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ satisfies the following properties.

> __Definition [well-behaved].__ Say that a cap $K$ is _well-behaved_ if it satisfies the following conditions. ^def-well-behaved
> 
> 1. $K$ has rotation angle $\pi/2$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ is injective with respect to $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 3. For any $t \in (0, \omega)$, we have $\mathbf{x}_K(t) \in H(\pi/2, 0)$. That is, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ is always on or above the $x$-axis.

So the cap of Gerver's sofa is well-behaved. But also note that the condition is much more general and there will be much more monotone sofas with well-behaving caps. The injectivity hypothesis states that there exists a sofa of maximum area with a well-behaved cap.
