We make a brief remark on why a computer-assisted approach may prove [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity]]. Give the space of caps $\mathcal{K}_{\pi/2}$ the Hausdorff measure. Then 

> __Theorem [gerver-injectivity].__ There exists a $\epsilon>0$ such that, for every $K$ close to the cap $K_G$ under Hausdorff norm < $\epsilon$, $\mathcal{A}(K)$ either does not attain the maximum area or  ^thm-gerver-injectivity

Because this theorem is irrelevant to the main result, we only give a brief sketch of the proof. But this also serves as a good blueprint to the actual proof of [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity-cap]].

_Proof._ 

- As $K \to K_G$, most of $g^+_K(t)$ and $h^+_K(t)$ converge to that of $K_G$, because the curvature at boundary of $K_G$ is bounded.
- Take $\delta$ sufficientlly small so that 0.01 neighborhood of $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ and $w_K(t)$ are strictly contained inside the niche $\mathcal{N}(K_G)$ of Gerver's sofa.
- The trouble occurs when $t$ is close to $0$ or $\pi/2$. For that you need to attach a bar above $K$. Even with bar attached,

So if Gerver's sofa attains the unique maximum area, then by Kallus-Romik we can eliminate all sofas. So in theory we can prove injectivity hypothesis by running their software for long enough.

Finally, we also state a variant on the optimization of area functional of an arbitrary cap. 

> __Conjecture [injectivity-cap].__ There is a cap $K_{\text{max}}$ attaining the maximum sofa area functional among all caps, such that $K_{\text{max}}$ is well-behaved. ^con-injectivity-cap

Note that [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity-cap]] is not implied by Gerver's conjecture, so technically it is not a weakening of Gerver's conjecture. Note also that neither [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity]] or [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity-cap]] directly imply each other. However, . Our upcoming work in progress, if successful, will prove exactly the variant [[01. Statement#^con-injectivity-cap]]. In this work, we prove
