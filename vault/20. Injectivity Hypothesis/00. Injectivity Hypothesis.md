We introduce the statement called _injectivity hypothesis_ here. The hypothesis states that there exists a sofa of maximum area that shares a couple properties that Gerver's sofa admits. This is a much weaker statement than the full Gerver's conjecture, because the requirement for injectivity hypothesis is much weaker.

Observe that the cap $K_G$ of Gerver's sofa $S_G$ satisfies the following properties.

> __Definition [well-behaved].__ For a cap $K$, say that it is _well-behaved_ if it satisfies the following conditions. ^def-well-behaved
> 
> 1. $S$ has rotation angle $90^{\circ}$.
> 2. The inner corner $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ of the rotating hallway $L_S(t)$ is injective with respect to $t \in [0, \pi/2]$.
> 3. The starting point $\mathbf{x}_K(0)$ of the arc is strictly on the right side of the ending point $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2)$ of the arc. That is, $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2) \cdot u_0 < \mathbf{x}_K(0) \cdot u_0$.
> 4. For any $t \in (0, \omega)$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ is inside $K$.

So [[00. Injectivity Hypothesis#^def-well-behaved]] captures some properties that Gerver's sofa satisfies. But also note that there will be much more sofas than 

> __Conjecture [injectivity].__ There is a monotone sofa $S = S_{\text{max}}$ attaining the maximum area among all sofas, with cap $K$ such that the cap of $S$ is well-behaved. ^con-injectivity

We also state a variant of injectivity hypothesis on the optimization of area functional of an arbitrary cap. 

> __Conjecture [injectivity-cap].__ There is a cap $K_{\text{max}}$ attaining the maximum sofa area functional among all caps, such that $K_{\text{max}}$ is well-behaved. ^con-injectivity-cap

[[00. Injectivity Hypothesis#^con-injectivity]] is a weakening of Gerver's conjecture. But [[00. Injectivity Hypothesis#^con-injectivity-cap]] is not. Note also that neither [[00. Injectivity Hypothesis#^con-injectivity]] or [[00. Injectivity Hypothesis#^con-injectivity-cap]] directly imply each other.

> __Theorem [gerver-injectivity].__ There exists a $\epsilon>0$ such that, for every $K$ close to the cap $K_G$ under Hausdorff norm < $\epsilon$, $\mathcal{A}(K)$ either does not attain the maximum area, or  ^thm-gerver-injectivity

Because this theorem is irrelevant to the main result, we only give a brief sketch of the proof. But this also serves as a good blueprint to the actual proof of [[00. Injectivity Hypothesis#^con-injectivity-cap]].

_Proof._ 

- As $K \to K_G$, most of $g^+_K(t)$ and $h^+_K(t)$ converge to that of $K_G$, because the curvature at boundary of $K_G$ is bounded.
- Take $\delta$ sufficientlly small so that 0.01 neighborhood of $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ and $w_K(t)$ are strictly contained inside the niche $\mathcal{N}(K_G)$ of Gerver's sofa.
- The trouble occurs when $t$ is close to $0$ or $\pi/2$. For that you need to attach a bar above $K$. Even with bar attached,

So if Gerver's sofa attains the unique maximum area, then by Kallus-Romik we can eliminate all sofas. So in theory we can prove injectivity hypothesis by running their software for long enough.

The conditions are already satisfied by Gerver's sofa. So, the statement here is much weaker than full Gerver's conjecture. The movie is We show that still, this weaker condition of Gerver's conjecture proves the full Gerver's conjecture, in this part. In next part, we will prove the injectivity theorem, .
