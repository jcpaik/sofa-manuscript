# Moving Sofa Problem

This is a draft on the moving sofa problem. It is an Obsidian Vault, a collection of Markdown documents and an `.obsidian` configuration file for a Markdown editor named [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). With this, we recommend you to view the files with Obsidian as of now. This vault is transpiled to LaTeX using a niche piece of software called [mathmd](https://github.com/jcpaik/mathmd).
