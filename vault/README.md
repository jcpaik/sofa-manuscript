# Moving Sofa Problem

This is a draft on the resolution of the moving sofa problem in progress. It is an Obsidian vault, a folder of Markdown documents and configuration files for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This vault is transpiled to LaTeX using a niche piece of software called [mathmd](https://github.com/jcpaik/mathmd).
