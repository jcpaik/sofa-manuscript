Page 9, first paragraph of section 2.3: the mathematical content of this paragraph is unclear. What does it mean "to enlarge a moving sofa ... by intersecting ..."? What do the phrases "without loss of generality" and "we can assume" mean?
  

Page 9, paragraph after corollary 2.3: what does "which is essential for theorem 2.1 to work" mean? Are you saying that Gerver didn't prove theorem 2.1, or something else?
