Page 9, first paragraph of section 2.3: the mathematical content of this paragraph is unclear. What does it mean "to enlarge a moving sofa ... by intersecting ..."? What do the phrases "without loss of generality" and "we can assume" mean?
  

Page 9, paragraph after corollary 2.3: what does "which is essential for theorem 2.1 to work" mean? Are you saying that Gerver didn't prove theorem 2.1, or something else?

  

Page 9, paragraph after theorem 2.4: the sentence "After proving Theorem 2.4, it will be possible to call any monotonization of a moving sofa a monotone sofa" is confusing. Why is it not possible to use this name before proving theorem 2.4? Theorem 2.4 gives us permission to use the term "moving sofa" for the monotonization, so are you implicitly using "sofa" and "moving sofa" as synonyms here?

  

Page 12, last paragraph of section 2.3.2: you use the word "projection" as if it's a formal term with a precise meaning, but it's not explained anywhere what it means, or what it means to "project" a moving sofa to a monotone sofa.



Page 16, first line of section 3.1. Why is the injectivity hypothesis "a much weaker statement of Gerver's conjecture"? This characterization seems a bit misleading to me. (E.g., there are many results that are implied by the Riemann hypothesis, but it wouldn't be reasonable to refer to any such result as "a much weaker version of the Riemann hypothesis.)
