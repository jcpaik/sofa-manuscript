- Set up $\psi_R, \psi_L$.
- Effective curves are:
	- $\mathbf{x} : [\psi_R, \psi_L] \to \mathbb{R}^2$
	- Cut the niche boundary with the line $d_K(\psi_R)$
		- On right, we have the curve of $\mathbf{x}$
		- On left, we have the curve bounded from below by $d_K(t)$ for $t \in [0, \psi_R]$
		- [ ] Mutual injectivity seems like not easy to prove


Planning for a new experimentation

- Primitive variables are $p$'s and $r$'s (support function of $A$ and $C$)
	- $q$ and $s$ for support functions of $B$ and $D$
- Left tail: angles inside $[0, \psi_R]$
- Right tail: angles inside $[\psi_L, \pi/2]$
- Upper bounds will be bounded from _below_ by Gerver's sofa.
- But all upper bounds will be vaild for any choice of $\psi_L, \psi_R$.
- This particular choice of upper bound will minimize $\mathcal{A}_2$.
