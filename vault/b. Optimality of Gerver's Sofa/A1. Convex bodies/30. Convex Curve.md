Define a convex curve with normal angles in $I$ as the union $\bigcup_{t \in I} e_K(t)$ of edges for some convex body $K$. Note that $K$ is forgotten in convex curve. By xx this is a Jordan path, curve, or a point.  

$\mathcal{B}_I$ is the structure of convex curves. $\mathcal{B}_I$ naturally have addition structure.
