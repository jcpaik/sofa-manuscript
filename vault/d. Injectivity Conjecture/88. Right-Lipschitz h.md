This is an extension of [[a. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/00. Preface|00. Preface]], so full familiarity on that chapter is needed to read this.

Take the finite angle set $\Theta := \Theta_n$ of size $n - 1$ and uniform gap $\delta = (\pi/2) / n$. Use three consecutive angles $t - \delta$, $t$, and $t + \delta$ in $\Theta \cup \{0, \pi/2\}$, so that $t \in \Theta$ in particular. Assume the polygon cap $K_\Theta$ of maximum area in [[a. Angle Hypothesis/10. Balanced Sofa/15. Maximum Polygon Cap#^thm-maximum-area-polygon-cap]]. 

We analyze how much the half-line $d_K(t)$ contributes to the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$, bounding $\nu_{K_{\Theta}}(t + \pi/2)$ from above. Then by the balancedness of 

Ignore the right side of $b_K(t)$, $b_K(t \pm \delta)$ completely. This sacrifices the contribution above.

$g_K^+(t)$ is the length between $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$ and $a_K(t) \cap a_K(t + \delta)$.

$g_K^+(t) - (1 - \tan (\delta / 2))$ ignored.

$(1 + \tan (\delta / 2)) - g_K^-(t)$ ignored.

Total ignored: $\tan \delta \cdot\max(0, g_K^+(t) - 1 + \tan (\delta/2), 1 + \tan (\delta / 2) - g_K^-(t))$.

$\sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$ if lower bounded by $2 \tan (\delta / 2)$, then should be at most the ignored above.

Make the continuous version. $\max(1, |g_K^{\pm}(t) - 1|)$. This integrated.

$h_K^+(t) = h_K^-(t) + \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$.

$h_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^-(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^+(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) - \sec \delta \cdot \sigma$.

Bounds $\sec \delta \geq 1$
$\tan \delta = \delta + O(\delta^3)$
$\sec \delta < \delta + O(\delta^3)$
$\delta g_K^+(t - \delta) = \int_{t - \delta}^t g_K^{\pm}(u) \, du + O(\delta^2)$
Using the estimates, we get
$h_K^+(t - \delta) \geq h_K^+(t) - O(\delta^2)$

Sum over, and $O(\delta)$ terms cannot be ignored but $O(\delta^2)$ and smaller can be ignored
(we sum $O(1/\delta)$ terms)

_Proof._ Circle chord! Observe that $\mathbf{y}_K$ on $I$ is on the circle of diameter $A_K^-(t)$ and $C_K^-(t)$. Diameter at most 4. â–¡



Q. How does $h^{\pm}_{K_n}$ and $g_{K_n}^{\pm}$ converge to that of $K$ as $n \to \infty$?

Really hope it converges in integral. That is, integral of them on intervals converge.
Can assume closed or open; single point zeroes out always.





Definitely not pointwise. 


To prove (TODO):

$g$ at least one -> $h'$ increasing by at least g>=1, decreases by at most max(one, g - 1). Either way h' never decreases.

no condition on $g$ -> $h'$ increases by $g$, decreases by at most max(one, |g-1|). Either way h' decreases in total by at most one.

Then:

$h$ at least one on interval $[0, \pi/4]$ (compute using SofaDesigner)

symmetry. $g$ at least one on interval $[\pi/4, \pi/2]$.

$h$ exactly one on $\pi/2$. $g$ at least one. use above to conclude $h$ at least one. Monotonicity!

HMM.. let's try again.

WLOG $g$ at least one on interval $[\pi/2 - 0.1, \pi/2]$. $g(\pi/2) > 1.1$ or something like that.

So $h$ is at least one on $[\pi/2 - 0.1, \pi/2]$. 

That means $g$ is ...

We need _lower bound_ on $\sigma$ to establish any computer free proof. But this could definitely be zero in Gerver's sofa.
