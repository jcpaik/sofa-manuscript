Setup: finite angle set $\Theta$ of uniform gap $\delta$. Angle $t$ in $\Theta$. Use three angles $t - \delta$ and $t + \delta$.

Assume polygon cap $K_\Theta$ of maximum area. 

We analyze how much the line $d_K(t)$ contributes to the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$.

Ignore the right side of $b_K(t)$, $b_K(t \pm \delta)$ completely. This sacrifices the contribution above.

$g_K^+(t)$ is the length between $\mathbf{y}_K(t)$ and $a_K(t) \cap a_K(t + \delta)$.

$g_K^+(t) - (1 - \tan (\delta / 2))$ ignored.

$(1 + \tan (\delta / 2)) - g_K^-(t)$ ignored.

Total ignored: $\tan \delta \cdot\max(0, g_K^+(t) - 1 + \tan (\delta/2), 1 + \tan (\delta / 2) - g_K^-(t))$.

$\sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$ if lower bounded by $2 \tan (\delta / 2)$, then should be at most the ignored above.

$h_K^+(t) = h_K^-(t) + \sigma_K(t + \pi/2)$.

$h_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^-(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) = \sec \delta \cdot h_K^+(t) + \tan \delta \cdot g_K^+(t - \delta) - \sec \delta \cdot \sigma$.


$g$ at least one -> $h'$ increasing by at least g>=1, decreases by at most max(one, g - 1). Either way h' never decreases.

no condition on $g$ -> $h'$ increases by $g$, decreases by at most max(one, |g-1|). Either way h' decreases in total by at most one.

$h$ at least one on interval $[0, \pi/4]$ (compute using SofaDesigner)

symmetry. $g$ at least one on interval $[\pi/4, \pi/2]$.

$h$ exactly one on $\pi/2$. $g$ at least one. use above to conclude $h$ at least one. Monotonicity!
