> __Definition [hallway].__ The _hallway_ $L = L_H \cup L_V$ is the union of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$, each representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. ^def-hallway

> __Definition [strip].__ Define the unit-width horizontal and vertical strips $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ respectively. ^def-strip

In the introduction, we gave a definition of a moving sofa $S$ as a subset of $L_H$. However, the condition that $S$ should be confined in $L_H$ is a bit restrictive for our future use. So we will also call any translation of such $S \subseteq L_H$ a _moving sofa_ as well without loss of generality.

> __Definition [sofa].__ A _moving sofa_ $S$ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, such that a translation of $S$ is a subset of $L_H$ that admits a continuous rigid motion inside $L$ from $L_H$ to $L_V$. ^def-sofa

It is safe assume that a moving sofa is always closed, since for any subset of $L$ its closure is also contained in $L$. We also define the rotation angle $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ Say that a moving sofa $S$ have the _rotation angle_ $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ if the continuous rigid motion of a translate of $S$ from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$ rotates the body clockwise by $\omega$ in its full movement. ^def-rotation-angle

With the result of [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018] that $\omega \in [81.203\dots^\circ, 90^\circ]$ for a maximum-area moving sofa, we will always assume that a moving sofa have rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$. For each rotation angle $\omega$, we define the following notions for future use.

> __Definition [rotation-map].__ Define $R_\theta : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the rotation map of $\mathbb{R}^2$ around the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $\theta \in S^1$. ^def-rotation-map

> __Definition [parallelogram].__ For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, define the _parallelogram_ $P_\omega = H \cap R_\omega(V)$ with _rotation angle_ $\omega$.[^parallelogram] ^def-parallelogram

> __Definition [j-cap].__ For any $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, define the set $J_\omega = [0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \omega + \pi/2]$. ^def-j-cap

For reference, the notion of _standard position_ of a moving sofa will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-standard-position]]. The _monotonization_ $\mathcal{M}(S)$, _cap_ $\mathcal{C}(S)$, and _niche_ $\mathcal{N}(K)$ of a moving sofa $S$ will be defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-monotonization]], [[15. Monotone sofas/10. Monotonization#^def-cap-sofa]], and [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a Monotone Sofa#^def-niche]] respectively.

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ as ^def-tangent-hallway
$$
L_S(t) = R_t(L) + (p_S(t) - 1)  u_t + (p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t.
$$

Note that $R_t$ is the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ along the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $t$ ([[10. Notations and Conventions/02. Moving Sofa#^def-rotation-map]]). The equation of $L_S(t)$ in [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-tangent-hallway]] is determined by the following defining property of $L_S(t)$.

> __Proposition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ is the unique rigid transformation of $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$, such that the outer walls of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the outer walls $a$ and $c$ of $L$ are the tangent lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi/2)$ of $S$ respectively. ^pro-tangent-hallway

> __Definition [shape].__ In this paper, a _shape_ $S$ is a nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-shape

> __Definition [frame].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, define the unit vectors $u_t = \left( \cos t, \sin t \right)$ and $v_t = \left( -\sin t,\cos t \right)$. ^def-frame

Any line on $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be described by the angle $t$ of its normal vector $u_t$ and its (signed) distance from the origin.

> __Definition [line].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the line $l(t, h)$ with the _normal angle_ $t$ and the signed distance $h$ from the origin as ^def-line
$$
l(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t = h \right\}.
$$

A line on $\mathbb{R}^2$ divids the plane into two half-planes. Following [[10. Notations and Conventions/00. Preface#^def-line]], we also give a name to one of the half-planes in the direction of $-u_t$.

> __Definition [half-plane].__ For any angle $t$ in $S^1$ and a value $h \in \mathbb{R}$, define the closed _half-plane_ $H(t, h)$ with the boundary $l(t, h)$ as ^def-half-plane
$$
H(t, h) = \left\{ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 : p \cdot u_t \leq h \right\}.
$$
> We say that the closed half-plane $H(t, h)$ has the _normal angle_ $t$.

Fix a shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$. Take a sufficiently large $h \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $H(t, h) \supseteq S$. As we decrease $h$ continuously, the line $l(t, h)$ will get close to $S$ until it makes contact with $S$ for the first time. We define the value of $h$, tangent line $l(t, h)$, tangent half-plane $H(t, h)$ as the following [[10. Notations and Conventions/00. Preface#^def-support-function]], [[10. Notations and Conventions/00. Preface#^def-tangent-line]] and [[10. Notations and Conventions/00. Preface#^def-tangent-half-plane]].

> __Definition [support-function].__ For any shape $S$, define its _support function_ $p_S : S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ as the value $p_S(t) = \sup \left\{ p \cdot u_t : p \in S \right\}$. ^def-support-function

> __Definition [tangent-line].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent line_ $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $l_S(t) := l(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-line

> __Definition [tangent-half-plane].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent half-plane_ $H_S(t)$ of $S$ with _normal angle_ $t$ as the line $H_S(t) := H(t, p_S(t))$. ^def-tangent-half-plane

Observe that the support function $p_S(t)$ measures the signed distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the tangent line $l_S(t)$ of $S$ with the normal vector $u_t$ directing outwards from $S$. Support function and tangent lines of $S$ are usually studied when $S$ is a convex body (e.g. p45 of [[@schneider_2013]]), but in this paper we generalize the notion to arbitrary shape $S$.

The following notion of _width_ along a direction is also studied for convex bodies (e.g. p49 of [[@schneider_2013]]).

> __Definition [width].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t$ in $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$, the _width_ of $S$ along the direction of unit vector $u_t$ is defined as $p_S(t) + p_S(t + \pi)$. ^def-width

Geometrically, the width of $S$ along $u_t$ measures the distance between the parallel tangent lines $l_S(t)$ and $l_S(t + \pi)$ of $S$.

We adopt the following definition of a convex body (p8 of [[@schneider_2013]]).

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-convex-body

Many authors often also include the condition that $K^\circ$ is nonempty, but we allow $K^\circ$ to be empty (that is, $K$ can be a closed line segment or a point).

In this paper only, we use the following notions of _vertices_ and _edges_ of a planar convex body $K$.

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, define the _edge_ $e_K(t)$ of $K$ as the intersection of $K$ with the tangent line $l_K(t)$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Definition [convex-body-vertex].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, let $v_K^+(t)$ and $v_K^-(t)$ be the endpoints of the edge $e_K(t)$ such that $v_K^+(t)$ is positioned farthest in the direction of $v_t$ and $v_K^-(t)$ is positioned farthest in the opposite direction of $v_t$. We call $v_K^{\pm}(t)$ the _vertices_ of $K$. ^def-convex-body-vertex

It is possible that the edge $e_K(t)$ can be a single point. In such case, the tangent line $l_K(t)$ touches $K$ at the single point $v_K^+(t) = v_K^-(t)$. In fact, it turns out that this holds for every $t \in S^1$ except for a countable number of values of $t$ ([[A1. Convex bodies/10. Surface Area Measure#^pro-surface-area-singleton-almost-everywhere]]).

For reference, the notion of cap $K$ as a kind of convex bodies is defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/12. Structure of a Monotone Sofa#^def-cap]]. The space of all caps $\mathcal{K}_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$ is defined in [[20. Sofa Area Functional A/00. Preface#^def-cap-space]]. The vertices $A_K^{\pm}(t)$, $C_K^{\pm}(t)$ of a cap $K$ is defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/15. Cap Contains Niche#^def-cap-vertices]]. The upper boundary $\delta K$ of a cap $K$ is defined in [[15. Monotone sofas/15. Cap Contains Niche#^def-upper-boundary-of-cap]].

> __Definition [tangent-hallway-map].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the rigid transformation $f_{S, t} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as ^def-tangent-hallway-map
$$
f_{S, t}(z) = R_t(z) + (p_S(t) - 1)  u_t + (p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t
$$
> so that $f_{S, t}$ maps $L$ to $L_S(t)$.

> __Definition [rotating-hallway-parts].__ For any shape $S$ and angle $t \in S^1$, let $\mathbf{x}_S(t), \mathbf{y}_S(t), a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t), d_S(t), Q^+_S(t), Q^-_S(t)$ be the parts of $L_S(t)$ corresponding to the parts $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, a, b, c, d, Q^+, Q^-$ of $L$ respectively. That is, for any $? = \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, a, b, c, d, Q^+, Q^-$, let $?_S(t) := f_{S, t}(?)$. ^def-rotating-hallway-parts

> __Proposition [rotating-hallway-parts].__ We have $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ and $Q^+_S(t) = H_S(t) \cap H_S(t + \pi/2)$. Also we have the following representations of the parts purely in terms of the supporting function $p_S$ of $S$. ^pro-rotating-hallway-parts
$$
\begin{gather*}
\mathbf{x}_S(t) = (p_S(t) - 1) u_t + (p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) v_t \\
\mathbf{y}_S(t) = p_S(t) u_t + p_S(t + \pi/2) v_t \\
a_S(t) = l_S(t) = l(t, p_S(t)) \\
b_S(t) \subseteq l(t, p_S(t) - 1) \\
c_S(t) = l_S(t + \pi/2) = l(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2)) \\
d_S(t) \subseteq l(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1) \\
Q_S^+(t) = H(t, p_S(t)) \cap H(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2)) \\
Q_S^-(t) = H(t, p_S(t) - 1)^{\circ} \cap H(t + \pi/2, p_S(t + \pi/2))^{\circ}
\end{gather*}
$$

_Proof._ The formulas for $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ and $\mathbf{y}_S(t)$ are obtained by letting $z$ equal to $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ or $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ in the equation of [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^def-tangent-hallway-map]]. The formulas for $a_S(t), b_S(t), c_S(t)$, and $d_S(t)$ follows from the proof of [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway]]. The equality $L_S(t) = Q_S^+(t) \setminus Q_S^-(t)$ follows from mapping $L = Q^+ \setminus Q^-$ under the transformation $f_{S, t}$. The equality $Q^+_S(t) = H_S(t) \cap H_S(t + \pi/2)$ follows from that $Q^+_S(t)$ is a cone bounded by tangent lines $a_S(t) = l_S(t)$ and $c_S(t) = l_S(t + \pi/2)$ as in the proof of [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^pro-tangent-hallway]]. The formulas for $Q_S^-(t)$ and $Q_S^+(t)$ in terms of $p_S$ now follow from [[10. Notations and Conventions/03. Convex Body#^def-tangent-half-plane]] and that $Q_S^-(t)$ is bounded by $b_S(t)$ and $d_S(t)$. □
