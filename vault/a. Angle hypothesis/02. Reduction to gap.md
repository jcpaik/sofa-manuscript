Assume $d := p_K(0) \geq 1.1$ without loss of generality. Otherwise, if $p_K(0), p_K(\omega + \pi/2) \leq 1.1$, then the area of the cap itself is less than $2.2$, so it cannot attain the maximum area sofa.

What is the lower bound for the upper gap then? Take the point $r$ such that $r \cdot u_\omega = 1$ and $r \cdot u_0 = d$. This is the 'farthest' point to the right from the origin. Now the bottom right gap $w_K(t)$ is bounded from below by the circle of radius 1 centered at $r$.
