> __Theorem [balanced-consumed].__ Let $K \in \mathcal{K}_\omega$ be the maximizer of $\mathcal{A}_\omega(K)$  ^thm-balanced-consumed

Assume $d := p_K(0) \geq 1.1$ without loss of generality. Otherwise, if $p_K(0), p_K(\omega + \pi/2) \leq 1.1$, then the area of the cap itself is less than $2.2$, so it cannot attain the maximum area sofa.

What is the lower bound for the upper gap then? Take the point $r$ such that $r \cdot u_\omega = 1$ and $r \cdot u_0 = d$. This is the 'farthest' point to the right from the origin. Let $q_0$ be the projection of $r$ to the line $y=0$. The $y$-coordinate of $r$ is
$$
r_y = \frac{1 - r_x \cdot \cos \omega}{\sin \omega}.
$$
Now the bottom right gap $w_K(t)$ is bounded from below by the circle of radius 1 centered at $r$. Now the right-angled triangle formed by side of length 1 connecting $W_K(t)$ and $r$ have height at most $r_y$, so the wedge gap $w_K^{\circ}$ is at least $g := \sqrt{1 - r_y^2}$. Now the point $q := o_\omega - (g, 0)$ is inside the cap $K$ by the balancedness condition.

Take the angle $t = \pi/2 - \omega$ and observe that $t \in [0, \omega]$. It should be that $Q_K^+(t)$ contains the points $q_0$ and $q_1$. Take the set $X = \left\{ q_0, q_1 \right\}$. Take the hallway $L' = L_X(t)$ which is $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$, and that the outer walls pass through $q_0$ in the vertical line and $q_1$ in the horizontal line. We need to verify $q_0 \cdot u_t > q_1 \cdot u_t$ and $q_1 \cdot v_t > q_0 \cdot v_t$. Then, the inner quadrant $Q_X^-(t)$ should be contained in the quadrant $Q_K^-(t)$.

Next, we show that the points $O = (0, 0)$ and $o_\omega - v_0$, $o_\omega - u_\omega$ are contained in the inner quadrant $Q_X^-(t)$. This is done by calculation.
