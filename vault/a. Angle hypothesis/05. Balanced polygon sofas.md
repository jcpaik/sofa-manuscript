In this [[a. Angle hypothesis/05. Balanced Polygon Sofas|05. Balanced Polygon Sofas]], our goal is to show the [[a. Angle hypothesis/05. Balanced polygon sofas#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]] which states that the maximizing polygon cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ of the polygon sofa area $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K)$ is _balanced_ in the sense of Gerver. We postpone its full statement and proof of [[a. Angle hypothesis/05. Balanced polygon sofas#^thm-balanced-polygon-sofa]] at the end as it involves a bit of technicalties.

Our main idea is to use the balancing argument as described in [[a. Angle hypothesis/01. Introduction/05. Balancedness]], we circumvented the issue of preserving the connectedness by separtating the cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ from its polygon niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ in our polygon sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$. Consequently, we need to take account of both the cap $K$ and the niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$ in our balancing strategy. Use support function $h = p_K$ as the controller for cap $K$ and niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$.

Let $\Theta^* := \Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup \left\{ \omega + \pi, 3\pi/2 \right\}$. Then the support function $h = p_K$ of the cap $K$ restricted to the set $\Theta^*$ determines the cap ^eqn-cap-support-ftn
$$
K = \bigcap_{t \in \Theta^*} H^-(t, h(t))
$$
and the polygon niche ^eqn-niche-support-ftn
$$
\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}(K) = H_-(\omega + \pi, h(\omega + \pi)) \cap H_-(3\pi/2, h(3\pi/2)) \cap
\bigcup_{t \in \Theta} \left( H_-^{\circ}(t, h(t) - 1) \cap H_-^\circ(t + \pi/2, h(t + \pi/2) - 1) \right) 
$$
completely. More specifically, they are Nef polygons determined by the hyperplanes with angle $t \in \Theta^*$ and distance $h(t)$ or $h(t) - 1$ from the origin. So the area functional $\mathcal{A}_\Theta(K)$ is a function of the support function $h : \Theta^* \to \mathbb{R}$.

Assume that $K$ is not balanced. We now execute the balancing strategy by tweaking the individual values of $h : \Theta^* \to \mathbb{R}$ to $h'$ and make the corresponding area functional $|K| - |\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}(K)|$ larger. The issue is that, as we tweak the values of $h$ to $h'$, there might not be a corresponding cap $K' \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ such that $h'$ is the support function $p_{K'}$. We circumvent this issue by carefully choosing the direction of push, so that after the push the new intersection $K'$ is always a cap as well.

- Define $\mathcal{K}_\Theta'$ as the space of all translations of caps in $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$. 
- pushout -> preserves cap.
- The upper boundary $\delta K$ is a sequence of segments (some length zero) from left to right, connecting $C_K^+(\omega)$ to $A_K^-(0)$.
- The boundary of $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a polyline $\mathbf{p}_K$, from left to right, connecting $C_K^+(\omega)$ to $A_K^-(0)$.
	- Need wedge gap.
- The contribution of $l(\pi/2, 0)$ on $\mathbf{p}_K$ is exactly $\kappa_K(3\pi/2) - \nu_K(3\pi/2)$. 
	- Wedge gap is a lower bound for it.
-  outer edges of K <= inner edges of niche => should be that the outer edge of something is strictly larger. for the 'bands',
