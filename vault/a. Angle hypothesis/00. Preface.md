Moving a large couch through a narrow hallway requires not only strength but also well-planned pivoting. The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, is a two-dimensional idealization of such a situation:

> What is the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ of a connected shape that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway with unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of sets $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ representing the horizontal and vertical side of $L$ respectively. A _moving sofa_ $S$ may be defined as a connected subset of $L_H$ that can be moved inside $L$ by a continuous rigid motion to a subset of $L_V$. It is known that there exists a moving sofa attaining the maximum area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992], but the precise value of $\mu_{\text{max}}$ remains unknown despite decades of attempts.

The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as ^eqn-best-bounds
$$
2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37.
$$
The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994 [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] (see [[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^fig-gerver]]). Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum possible area, so that $\mu_G = \mu_{\max}$ ([[01. Introduction/00. Preface#^con-gerver]]). On the other hand, the upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using computer assistance [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018].

The _rotation angle_ $\omega$ of a moving sofa $S$ is the clockwise angle that $S$ rotates as it moves from $L_H$ to $L_V$ inside $L$. Gerver's sofa has the rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. On the other hand, the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ can move inside $L$ with only translation, so it has the rotation angle $\omega = 0$. Let $\omega$ is the rotation angle of a moving sofa of maximum area. Gerver showed in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] that we can assume $\pi/ 3 \leq \omega \leq \pi/2$. Kallus and Romik improved the lower bound of $\omega$ by showing that $\omega \geq \arcsin(84/85) = 81.203\dots^\circ$ [@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]. With this, we will only consider moving sofas with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, and it seems reasonable to conjecture that a maximum-area moving sofa has $\omega = \pi/2$.

> __Conjecture [angle].__ (Angle Hypothesis) There exists a maximum-area moving sofa with a movement of rotation angle $\omega = \pi/2$. ^con-angle

> __Remark [angle].__ A single shape $S$ may admit different moving sofa movements in $L$ with varying rotation angles $\omega$. For any moving sofa $S$ mentioned in this paper, we will always assume a fixed rotation angle $\omega$ attached to it. So any moving sofa $S$ in this paper is technically a tuple of a shape and its fixed rotation angle. In this way, we can talk about _the_ rotation angle of a moving sofa. ^rem-angle

In this paper, we prove [[a. Angle hypothesis/00. Preface#^con-angle]] by proving the following theorem.

> __Theorem [angle].__ Let $\omega \in [\pi/3, \pi/2]$ be an arbitrary angle. There exists a moving sofa $S_\omega$ with rotation angle $\omega$, attaining the maximum area among all moving sofas of rotation angle $\omega$, such that $S_\omega$ also admits a movement in $L$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$.

# Proof outline

A powerful idea described in [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992] is that a moving sofa is essentially the intersection of rotating _hallways_, if we look at the movement of $S$ inside $L$ in the perspective of $S$. Using this idea, one can show that there exists a maximum-area moving sofa $S$ with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$, so that it is the intersection of the following sets.

1. For every angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, the hallway $L_t$, which is $L$ rotated counterclockwise by $t$ and translated so that the outer walls of $L_t$ is in contact with $S$.
2. The horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$.
3. The set $V_\omega$, which is the vertical strip $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ rotated counterclockwise by $\omega$ along the origin.

Such a sofa $S$ satisfying the equation
$$
S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} L_t
$$
is called a _monotone sofa_. 

Assume $\omega < \pi/2$. Define $p_\omega$ as the upper-right corner of the parallelogram $P_\omega := H \cap V_\omega$. Define $\Delta_\omega$ as the subset of $P_\omega$ which is under the arc from $p_\omega - u_\omega$ to $p_\omega - v_0$ formed by the circle of radius 1 centered at $p_\omega$. If the small region $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from the moving sofa $S$, then it turns out that one can rotate $S$ inside $H$ _counterclockwise_ by an angle of $\pi/2 - \omega$. Combine this movement with the movement of $S$ in $L$ to get a movement of $S$ with rotation angle $\pi/2$.

So how do we show that $\Delta_\omega$ is disjoint from $S$? We will show that there is some $t$ such that the inner corner $Q_K^-(t)$ contains the set $\Delta_\omega$. We will need to bound two values from below. First is the length $p_K(0)$ from the origin. Second is the length of the edge $e_K(\pi/2)$ with the normal vector $(0, 1)$. Now the points $q_1 = (p_K(0), 0)$ and $q_2 = o_\omega - \beta_K(\pi/2)$ are in $K$. The positive quadrant $Q_K^+(t)$ of the hallway $L_t$ should contain the two points $q_1$ and $q_2$. We find a proper value of $t$ so that the negative quadrant $Q_K^-(t)$ contains the set $\Delta_\omega$ all.

## Balancedness

Let $\mathbf{x}(t)$ be the location of the inner corner of the rotated hallway $L_t$. Then $L_t = R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t)$ and the maximum-area moving sofa $S$ is equal to the set
$$
S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t) \right).
$$
and the problem becomes the maximization of the area of $S$ with respect to the coordinates $\mathbf{x}:[0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of inner corners $L_t$.

Gerver derived his sofa $S_G$ using the following approximation scheme. Instead of taking the intersection of all rotated hallways $L_t$ with angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, he took a finite partition $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$ (that is, a finite subset of $[0, \omega]$ containing $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\}$) and took the polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
S_\Theta = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t) \right) .
$$
The approximated finite-dimensional problem is now to maximize the area of $S_\Theta$ with respect to the coordinates $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for $t \in \Theta$. Assume now that $S_\Theta$ attains the maximum area for each fixed partition $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$. Then Gerver used a compactness argument to show that there is a sequence of paritions $\Theta_1, \Theta_2, \dots, \Theta_n, \dots$ of $[0, \omega]$ that gets denser in the interval $[0, \omega]$, so that the polygons $S_{\Theta_n}$ converge to a moving sofa $S_\omega$ that attains the maximum area amongst all sofas with rotation angle $\omega$.

For a fixed finite partition $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$, Gerver claimed that the polygon $S_\Theta$ in [[#^eqn-polygon]] attaining the maximum area should be _balanced_ (Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]). That is, for any angle $t \in S^1$, the sum $a_t$ of length of edges of $S_\Theta$ with normal vectors $u_t$ is equal to the sum $b_t$ of length of edges of $S_\Theta$ with normal vectors $-u_t$. 

However, such a process may break the connectedness of the intersection $S_\Theta$. Consider the example in Figure xx with $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/6, \pi/3 \right\}$. If we take the hallway $L_{\pi/6}$ and compare the right outer wall with right inner wall, it is that the right outer wall contributes the most. However, if we do push $\mathbf{x}(\pi/6)$ towards the direction of 

In this paper, we mitigate the issue by defining the _sofa area functional_ that separates the area contribution of the cap $K$ and its niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. 

On the way of proving [[a. Angle hypothesis/00. Preface#^thm-angle-cap]], we also show the following existence theorem of maxima of $\mathcal{A}_\omega$ satisfying certain properties.
