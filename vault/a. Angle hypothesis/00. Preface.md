## Balancedness

Let $\mathbf{x}(t)$ be the location of the inner corner of the rotated hallway $L_t$. Then $L_t = R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t)$ and the maximum-area moving sofa $S$ is equal to the set
$$
S = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in [0, \omega]} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t) \right).
$$
and the problem becomes the maximization of the area of $S$ with respect to the coordinates $\mathbf{x}:[0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ of inner corners $L_t$.

Gerver derived his sofa $S_G$ using the following approximation scheme. Instead of taking the intersection of all rotated hallways $L_t$ with angle $t \in [0, \omega]$, he took a finite partition $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$ (that is, a finite subset of $[0, \omega]$ containing $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\}$) and took the polygon intersection ^eqn-polygon
$$
S_\Theta = H \cap V_\omega \cap \bigcap_{t \in \Theta} \left( R_t(L) + \mathbf{x}(t) \right) .
$$
The approximated finite-dimensional problem is now to maximize the area of $S_\Theta$ with respect to the coordinates $\mathbf{x}(t)$ for $t \in \Theta$. Assume now that $S_\Theta$ attains the maximum area for each fixed partition $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$. Then Gerver used a compactness argument to show that there is a sequence of paritions $\Theta_1, \Theta_2, \dots, \Theta_n, \dots$ of $[0, \omega]$ that gets denser in the interval $[0, \omega]$, so that the polygons $S_{\Theta_n}$ converge to a moving sofa $S_\omega$ that attains the maximum area amongst all sofas with rotation angle $\omega$.

For a fixed finite partition $\Theta$ of $[0, \omega]$, Gerver claimed that the polygon $S_\Theta$ in [[#^eqn-polygon]] attaining the maximum area should be _balanced_ (Theorem 1 of [@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]). That is, for any angle $t \in S^1$, the sum $a_t$ of length of edges of $S_\Theta$ with normal vectors $u_t$ is equal to the sum $b_t$ of length of edges of $S_\Theta$ with normal vectors $-u_t$. 

However, such a process may break the connectedness of the intersection $S_\Theta$. Consider the example in Figure xx with $\Theta = \left\{ \pi/6, \pi/3 \right\}$. If we take the hallway $L_{\pi/6}$ and compare the right outer wall with right inner wall, it is that the right outer wall contributes the most. However, if we do push $\mathbf{x}(\pi/6)$ towards the direction of 

In this paper, we mitigate the issue by defining the _sofa area functional_ that separates the area contribution of the cap $K$ and its niche $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)$. We will optimize for the value $|K| - |\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K)|$, no matter whether $\mathcal{N}_\Theta(K) \subseteq K$ or not. We will analyze the 

On the way of proving [[a. Angle hypothesis/00. Preface#^thm-angle-cap]], we also show the following existence theorem of maxima of $\mathcal{A}_\omega$ satisfying certain properties.
