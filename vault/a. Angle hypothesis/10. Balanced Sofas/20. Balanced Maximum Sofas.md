- Take $\Theta_1 \subseteq \Theta_2 \subseteq \dots$ so that their union $\Theta = \cup_n \Theta_n$ is countable and dense in $[0, \omega]$.
- Take maximizer $K_n$ with angle set $\Theta_n$.
- Use Blasche convergence theorem, so that $K_{n_j} \to K$ for some cap $K$.
- In particular $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ . So 
	- Use that surface area measure converges weakly, so the support is still preserved.

- Next, we show that $\bigcup_{n} \mathcal{N}_{\Theta_n}(K) = \mathcal{N}(K)$. The containment $\subseteq$ is trivial. Take any $p \in \mathcal{N}(K)$. Then $p \in Q_K^-(t)$ for some $t \in (0, \omega)$. Take $t_0 \in \Theta$ sufficiently close to $t$ so that $p \in Q_K^-(t_0)$.
