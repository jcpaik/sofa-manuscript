> __Definition [curve-area-differentiable].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any curve with a continuously differentiable parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. With $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, define the _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ of $\Gamma$ as ^def-curve-area-differentiable
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t).
$$

> __Definition [curve-area-convex].__ Let $\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}_{a, b}$ be any convex curve with normal angles in $(a, b)$. Define its _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u})$ of $\mathbf{u}$ as ^def-curve-area-convex
$$
\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u}) := \frac{1}{2} \int_{t \in (a, b)} h_\mathbf{u}(t) \,\sigma_{\mathbf{u}}(dt).
$$

- Theorem stating that $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u}) + \mathcal{I}(v_{\mathbf{u}}^+(b), v_{\mathbf{u}}(a, b)) + \mathcal{I}(v_{\mathbf{u}}(a, b), v_\mathbf{u}^+(a))$ is the area of the region $\mathcal{M}_\mathbf{u}$.

> __Remark [curve-area].__ It turns out that [[d. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Convex Curves/20. Curve Area Functional#^def-curve-area-differentiable]] and [[d. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Convex Curves/20. Curve Area Functional#^def-curve-area-convex]] reconcile with each other. However, this requires supplying an absolutely continuous parametrization of an arbitrary convex curve $\mathbf{u}$. As this is rudimentary yet takes a lot of space, we omit this and treat them separately using different letters. ^rem-curve-area
