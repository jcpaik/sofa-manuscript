> __Definition [curve-area-differentiable].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any curve with a continuously differentiable parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. With $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, define the _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ of $\Gamma$ as ^def-curve-area-differentiable
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t).

> __Definition [curve-area-convex].__ Let $\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}_{a, b}$ be any convex curve with normal angles in $(a, b)$. Define its _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u})$ of $\mathbf{u}$ as ^def-curve-area-convex
$$
\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u}) := \frac{1}{2} \int_{t \in (a, b)} h_\mathbf{u}(t) \,\sigma_{\mathbf{u}}(dt).
$$

- Theorem stating that $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u}) + \mathcal{I}(v_{\mathbf{u}}^+(b), v_{\mathbf{u}}(a, b)) + \mathcal{I}(v_{\mathbf{u}}(a, b), v_\mathbf{u}^+(a))$ is the area of the region $\mathcal{M}_\mathbf{u}$.

> __Remark [curve-area].__ It turns out that [[d. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Convex Curves/20. Curve Area Functional#^def-curve-area-differentiable]] and [[d. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Convex Curves/20. Curve Area Functional#^def-curve-area-convex]] reconcile with each other. However, this requires supplying an absolutely continuous parametrization of an arbitrary convex curve $\mathbf{u}$. As this is rudimentary yet takes a lot of space, we omit this and treat them separately using different letters. ^rem-curve-area





We now collect theorems on the surface area measure $\sigma_K$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-convex-linear].__ (Equation (8.23), p464 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The surface area measure $\sigma_K$ is convex-linear with respect to $K$. ^thm-surface-area-measure-convex-linear

Recall that the _mixed volume_ $V(K_1, K_2)$ of any two planar convex bodies $K_1$ and $K_2$, defined in Theorem 5.1.7 in p280 of [[@schneider_2013]], is a non-negative value with the following properties.

> __Theorem [mixed-volume].__ (Theorem 5.1.7 and Equation 5.27 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The followings are true for any planar convex bodies $K, K_1, K_2$. ^thm-mixed-volume
> 
> 1. $V(K, K) = |K|$
> 2. $V(K_1, K_2)$ is bilinear in $K_1$ and $K_2$ ([[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/05. Vertex and support function#^def-convex-body-linear]]).
> 3. $V(K_1, K_2) = V(K_2, K_1)$

We have the following representation of mixed volume in terms of support function and surface area measure. Remark that for any measurable function $f$ on a space $X$ and a measure $\sigma$ on $X$, we denote the integral of $f$ with respect to $\sigma$ as $\left< f, \sigma \right>_{X} = \int_{x \in X} f(x)\,\sigma(dx)$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-area].__ (Equation 5.19 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The mixed volume $V(K_1, K_2)$ of any two planar convex bodies $K_1$ and $K_2$ can be represented as the following. ^thm-surface-area-measure-area
$$
V(K_1, K_2) = \left< p_{K_1}, \sigma_{K_2} \right>_{S^1} / 2
$$
> Consequently, the area $|K|$ of any planar convex body $K$ can be represented as the following.
$$
|K| = V(K, K) = \left< p_K, \sigma_K \right>_{S^1} / 2
$$
