Here, we define the _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ (resp. $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u})$) that maps any curve parametrization $\mathbf{x}$ (resp. convex curve $\mathbf{u}$) to a real value. If $\mathbf{x}$ (or $\mathbf{u}$) makes a Jordan curve, then 

> __Definition [curve-area-differentiable].__ Let $\Gamma$ be any curve with a piecewise continuously differentiable parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and its coordinates $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. Define its _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{I}(\Gamma)$ or $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ as ^def-curve-area-differentiable
$$
\mathcal{I}(\Gamma) := \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b x(t) dy(t) - y(t) dx(t).
$$

Interpreting the differential $d \mathbf{x}(t)$ as the pair $(d x(t), dy(t))$ of differentials of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ respectively, one may write $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ as
$$
\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \mathbf{x}(t) \times d\mathbf{x}(t) =  \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b R_{\pi/2}(\mathbf{x}(t)) \cdot d\mathbf{x}(t)
$$
instead, where $R_{\pi/2}(x, y) = (-y, x)$ is the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ along the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $\pi/2$. We also have the following additivity of $\mathcal{I}$.

> __Proposition [curve-area-functional-additive].__ If $\gamma$ is the concatenation of two curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ then $\mathcal{I}(\gamma) = \mathcal{I}(\alpha) + \mathcal{I}(\beta)$. ^pro-curve-area-functional-additive

By Green's theorem, we have the following.

> __Proposition [curve-area-functional-area].__ (Theorem 10.43, p289 of [@apostol2000visual]) If $\mathbf{x}$ is a Jordan curve oriented counterclockwise (resp. clockwise), then $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ is the exact area of the region enclosed by $\mathbf{x}$ (resp. the area with a negative sign). ^pro-curve-area-functional-area

If $\mathbf{x}$ is not closed (that is, $\mathbf{x}(a) \neq \mathbf{x}(b)$), the sofa area functional $\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x})$ measures the signed area of the region bounded by the curve $\mathbf{x}$, and two line segments connecting the origin to $\mathbf{x}(a)$ and $\mathbf{x}(b)$ respectively.

We define an analogous curve area functional $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u})$ for a convex curve $\mathbf{u}$.

> __Definition [curve-area-convex].__ Let $\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}_{a, b}$ be any convex curve with normal angles in $(a, b)$. Define its _curve area functional_ $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u})$ of $\mathbf{u}$ as ^def-curve-area-convex
$$
\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u}) := \frac{1}{2} \int_{t \in (a, b)} h_\mathbf{u}(t) \,\sigma_{\mathbf{u}}(dt).
$$

> __Remark [curve-area].__ The two definitions of curve area functional ([[d. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Convex Curves/20. Curve Area Functional#^def-curve-area-differentiable]] and [[d. Optimality of Gerver's Sofa/07. Convex Curves/20. Curve Area Functional#^def-curve-area-convex]]) match with each other in fact. However, rigorously establishing this will require supplying an absolutely continuous parametrization of an arbitrary convex curve $\mathbf{u}$. As this is rudimentary but takes a lot of space, we omit this and treat the curve area functional for piecewise continously differentialble curves and convex curves separately using different letters. ^rem-curve-area

$\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u})$ is closely related to the area of the following region $\mathcal{M}_\mathbf{u}$.

> __Definition [convex-curve-mamikon-region].__ For any $\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}^{(a, b)}$, define its _Mamikon region_ ^def-convex-curve-mamikon-region
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{u}} := \left( H_{\mathbf{u}}(a) \cap H_{\mathbf{u}}(b) \right)  \setminus \bigcap_{t \in [a, b]} H_{\mathbf{u}}(t).
$$



- Theorem stating that $\mathcal{J}(\mathbf{u}) + \mathcal{I}(v_{\mathbf{u}}^+(b), v_{\mathbf{u}}(a, b)) + \mathcal{I}(v_{\mathbf{u}}(a, b), v_\mathbf{u}^+(a))$ is the area of the region $\mathcal{M}_\mathbf{u}$.

We now collect theorems on the surface area measure $\sigma_K$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-convex-linear].__ (Equation (8.23), p464 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The surface area measure $\sigma_K$ is convex-linear with respect to $K$. ^thm-surface-area-measure-convex-linear

Recall that the _mixed volume_ $V(K_1, K_2)$ of any two planar convex bodies $K_1$ and $K_2$, defined in Theorem 5.1.7 in p280 of [[@schneider_2013]], is a non-negative value with the following properties.

> __Theorem [mixed-volume].__ (Theorem 5.1.7 and Equation 5.27 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The followings are true for any planar convex bodies $K, K_1, K_2$. ^thm-mixed-volume
> 
> 1. $V(K, K) = |K|$
> 2. $V(K_1, K_2)$ is bilinear in $K_1$ and $K_2$ ([[xx. Mamikon's Theorem/05. Vertex and support function#^def-convex-body-linear]]).
> 3. $V(K_1, K_2) = V(K_2, K_1)$

We have the following representation of mixed volume in terms of support function and surface area measure. Remark that for any measurable function $f$ on a space $X$ and a measure $\sigma$ on $X$, we denote the integral of $f$ with respect to $\sigma$ as $\left< f, \sigma \right>_{X} = \int_{x \in X} f(x)\,\sigma(dx)$.

> __Theorem [surface-area-measure-area].__ (Equation 5.19 of [[@schneider_2013]]) The mixed volume $V(K_1, K_2)$ of any two planar convex bodies $K_1$ and $K_2$ can be represented as the following. ^thm-surface-area-measure-area
$$
V(K_1, K_2) = \left< p_{K_1}, \sigma_{K_2} \right>_{S^1} / 2
$$
> Consequently, the area $|K|$ of any planar convex body $K$ can be represented as the following.
$$
|K| = V(K, K) = \left< p_K, \sigma_K \right>_{S^1} / 2
$$
