Define $\mathcal{K}^{\phi_1, \phi_2}$ as the datum of
- a cap $K$ of rotation angle $\pi/2$
- a convex curve $\mathbf{b}$ with normal vectors $u_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/4]$
	- such that $p_K(t) - p_{\mathbf{b}}(t) \leq 1$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$
	- and $\mathbf{b}(0)$ is on the $x$-axis
	- and $\mathbf{b}(\pi/4) = \mathbf{x}_{K}(\phi_1)$
- a convex curve $\mathbf{d}$ with normal vectors $v_t$ for $t \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$
	- such that $p_K(t) - p_{\mathbf{d}}(t) \leq 1$ for all $t \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$ 
	- and $\mathbf{d}(\pi/2)$ is on the $x$-axis
	- and $\mathbf{d}(\pi/4) = \mathbf{x}_K(\phi_2)$

Each element of $\mathcal{K}^{\phi_1, \phi_2}$ can be expressed in two ways.
One is support functions $(p_K, p_\mathbf{b}, p_\mathbf{d})$.
Another is boundary measure $(\beta_K, \beta_{\mathbf{b}}, \beta_{\mathbf{d}})$.

Boundary measure gradient is felt by support function...
$\beta_K(\phi_1)$ and $\beta_K(\phi_1 + \pi/2)$ are felt by $\mathbf{x}_K(\phi_1)$
and $\beta_\mathbf{b}(\pi/4)$ is felt by $\mathbf{b}(\pi/4)$.
They all contribute.

When we do calculus of variation, the total change is:
$$
\int \Delta p_K(t) \,\beta_K (dt) - 
\int \Delta p_\mathbf{b}(t) \,\beta_\mathbf{b} (dt) - 
\int \Delta p_\mathbf{d}(t) \,\beta_\mathbf{d} (dt)
$$
