Assume by contradiction that there is some $t \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$ such that $\mathbf{x}_K(\theta_L)$ is on or below the line $b_K(t)$. Then it should be that $\mathbf{x}_K(\theta_L) \cdot u_t \leq p_K(t) - 1$.

> __Theorem [corner-below-tail-maximization].__ $K = K_{t, \theta_L}$ attains the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ amongst $K$ such that $\mathbf{x}_K(\theta_L) \cdot u_t \leq p_K(t) - 1$. ^thm-corner-below-tail-maximization

The idea again, is to use [[15. Directional Derivative#^thm-variation-a1]]. The variation is exactly 
$$
\left< p_{K'} - p_K, \beta_K - \iota_K \right> 
$$



We claim that the maximizer is exactly equal to the following.
