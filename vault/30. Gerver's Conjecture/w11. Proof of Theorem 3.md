# Case division

We divide into cases of $\psi_R$ and $\psi_L$. 

Define $\mathcal{K}^{\phi_1, \phi_2}$ as the datum of
- a cap $K$ of rotation angle $\pi/2$
- a convex curve $\mathbf{b}$ with normal vectors $u_t$ for $t \in [0, \pi/4]$
	- such that $p_K(t) - p_{\mathbf{b}}(t) \leq 1$ for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$
	- and $\mathbf{b}(0)$ is on the $x$-axis
	- and $\mathbf{b}(\pi/4) = \mathbf{x}_{K}(\phi_1)$
- a convex curve $\mathbf{d}$ with normal vectors $v_t$ for $t \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$
	- such that $p_K(t) - p_{\mathbf{d}}(t) \leq 1$ for all $t \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$ 
	- and $\mathbf{d}(\pi/2)$ is on the $x$-axis
	- and $\mathbf{d}(\pi/4) = \mathbf{x}_K(\phi_2)$

Each element of $\mathcal{K}^{\phi_1, \phi_2}$ can be expressed in two ways.
One is support functions $(p_K, p_\mathbf{b}, p_\mathbf{d})$.
Another is boundary measure $(\beta_K, \beta_{\mathbf{b}}, \beta_{\mathbf{d}})$.

Boundary measure gradient is felt by support function...
$\beta_K(\phi_1)$ and $\beta_K(\phi_1 + \pi/2)$ are felt by $\mathbf{x}_K(\phi_1)$
and $\beta_\mathbf{b}(\pi/4)$ is felt by $\mathbf{b}(\pi/4)$.
They all contribute.

When we do calculus of variation, the total change is:
$$
\int \Delta p_K(t) \,\beta_K (dt) - 
\int \Delta p_\mathbf{b}(t) \,\beta_\mathbf{b} (dt) - 
\int \Delta p_\mathbf{d}(t) \,\beta_\mathbf{d} (dt)
$$

Interpolate from $K$ to $K'$. 

# Current Case

The maximizer consists of nine different stages.

$0 = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_9 = \pi/2$

$t_2 = \psi_R$ and $t_7 = \psi_L$



| - |   | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | XII | XI |
| - | - | - | -  | -   | -  | - | -  | -   | -   | -  |
| A | $\beta_K(dt)$ |   |    | x   | x  | x | x  | x   |     | x  |
| B | $\beta_{\mathbf{r}}(dt)$ |   |    |     |    |   | x  |     |     | x  |
| C | $\beta_K(dt + \pi/2)$ |  x |    | x   | x  | x | x  | x   |     |    |
| D | $\beta_{\mathbf{l}}(dt)$ |  x |    |     | x  |   |    |     |     |    |
| x | |    |    | x   | x  | x | x  | x   |     |    |

$\beta_K(dt + \pi/2) = dt/2$ and $\beta_{\mathbf{l}} ($ $t \in (t_0, t_1)$

Some systematic way to tabulate and keep track of 

Case where both $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{l}$ are strictly $45^\circ$ diagonal, then followed by some convex curve.
$\mathbf{r}$ diagonal length $\gamma_R$

I: 1/2, 1/2 split between $C_K$ and $\mathbf{l}$ initially
II: $\mathbf{l}$ dies out at some point. One can also seem to be able to wiggle around the sofa quite freely??
II & III: $t = \psi_R$ -> $\gamma_R$ affects two sides 
III: $t \in (\psi_R, \psi_L)$ -> $\mathbf{x}_K$ in effect, tails stop working
IV: tail starts kicking in
IV -> V: tail reaches 45 degree
