# Optimality of Gerver's Sofa

The _moving sofa problem_, first published by Leo Moser in 1966, asks for the connected shape with the largest area $\alpha_{\max}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. The best bounds currently known on $\alpha_{\max}$ are summarized as $2.2195\dots \leq \alpha_{\max} \leq 2.37$. The lower bound $2.2195\dots \leq \alpha_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\alpha_G = 2.2195\dots$ constructed in 1994, with 18 analytic curves and segments constituting the boundary. The upper bound $\alpha_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using extensive computer asisstance. We outline a program that aims to prove that Gerver's sofa $S_G$ attains the maximum area and thus the equality $\alpha_{\max} = \alpha_G$ holds at the lower bound.
