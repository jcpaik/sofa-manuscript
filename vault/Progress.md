# Angle Hypothesis

- [ ] Drawing
	- [ ] Main idea figure 
	- [ ] Balancedness figure
	- [ ] Comprehensive picture of monotone sofa
- [ ] Balancing argument

- [ ] Streamline Nef Polygons???
	- [ ] Monotone boolean function. intersection or union only.
	- [ ] Simple Nef polygons: Monotone boolean function of closed or open hyperplanes of different boundaries. No negation!
	- [ ] The formula becomes more true as each becomes more true.
	- [ ] Only one press is enough.
		- [ ] Divide others into chambers. Divide the theorem into each chamber.
		- [ ] 
		- [ ] In sliding $t = \omega, \pi/2$, say that we apply the lemma twice. First pushing the hyperplane while fixing the other one. Then push the hyperplane while fixing the other one. They don't interfere with each other.

# Gerver's Conjecture

- [ ] Solve one case
	- [ ] GOAL: Make a Manipulate where controls of $\psi_L, \psi_R$ gives corresponding 'optimum sofa'.
		- [x] Tabulate all ODE solutions
		- [ ] Make boundary conditions clear
		- [ ] Make a function that automatically solves ODEs from given order of cases
		- [ ] Plot them in Graphics
