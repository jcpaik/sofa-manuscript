# Angle Hypothesis

- [ ] Drawing
	- [ ] Balancedness figure
	- [ ] Comprehensive picture of monotone sofa

# Gerver's Conjecture


- [ ] Simpler argument???
	- Note that $x$-monotoneness could hold here!
		- 45 degree case analysis -> seems quite messy.
		- Could get rid of it with cleverer argument??
	- Trace middle with an interval of $\mathbf{x}$
	- 

- [ ] Solve one case
	- [ ] GOAL: Make a Manipulate where controls of $\psi_L, \psi_R$ gives corresponding 'optimum sofa'.
		- [x] Tabulate all ODE solutions
		- [ ] Make boundary conditions clear
		- [ ] Make a function that automatically solves ODEs from given order of cases
		- [ ] Plot them in Graphics
	- [ ] Improve Mathematica script
		- [ ] Make `Expand` faster
			- [ ] See why is it so slow
		- [ ] 
- [ ] Make all cases
	- [ ] Make implementation of A2 more streamlined
	- [ ] Check surface area measure, support function, etc. more clearly.
