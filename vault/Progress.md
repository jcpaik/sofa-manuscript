- [ ] Say that $G \in \mathcal{K}^\mathrm{i}$
  - [ ] Need $\sigma_K(0) = \sigma_K(\pi) = 0$
    - [ ] Comes from Equation (23) of Romik that $A(0) = (1, 0)$, and symmetry.
- [ ] Identify exact equation labels and symbols that determine Gerver's sofa in Romik's paper





- Delicacy
  - $B$ is obtained by cutting down $K$ with some half-planes
  - $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is obtained by taking union of all the regions under.
  - 
  - Want to show that a point in $R$ is in the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$.
