- Draw figures
	- Wedge gap $w_K$ and $z_K$
	- Tangent hallway and parts

# Priortization

1. Angle Hypothesis (likely no computers needed)
	1. Fix Gerver's polygon argument
	2. Probably get rid of computer assistance
2. Injectivity Hypothesis
	1. Should computers be involved?
		1. One route: A few case analysis may prove IH for smaller interval, from which we can prove better ones
	2. Wait for Gerver's (or Romik's) response
3. 


- [ ] Clearly define a sofa, so that it can admit multiple different movements and rotation angle $\omega$.
	- [ ] Write ambiguity explicitly
- [ ] Standard position -> translation
	- [ ] Propositions without proof -> Write something that makes a first-time reader 
- [ ] Angle Hypothesis and Injectivity Hypothesis relationship

# Progress -

- [ ] Write leg lower bound explicitly
