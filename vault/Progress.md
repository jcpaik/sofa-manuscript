- Make explanation of convexity of A1 much easier

# Priortization

1. Angle Hypothesis (likely no computers needed)
	1. Fix Gerver's polygon argument
	2. Probably get rid of computer assistance
2. Injectivity Hypothesis
	1. Should computers be involved?
		1. One route: A few case analysis may prove IH for smaller interval, from which we can prove better ones
	2. Wait for Gerver's (or Romik's) response
3. 


- [ ] Clearly define a sofa, so that it can admit multiple different movements and rotation angle $\omega$.
	- [ ] Write ambiguity explicitly
- [ ] Standard position -> translation
	- [ ] Propositions without proof -> Write something that makes a first-time reader 
- [ ] Angle Hypothesis and Injectivity Hypothesis relationship

# Progress -

- [ ] Write leg lower bound explicitly
- [ ] Write argument explicitly
- [ ] Do experiment on bounding y-coord of corner x
- [ ] Do experiment on distant gaps
- [ ] 

# Angle and Injectivity

- [ ] Check preliminary calculations on gap
	- [ ] Angle
		- [x] Number check
		- [ ] Write the check in words in detail
	- [ ] Injectivity
		- [ ] Write the explicit theorems
		- [ ] Number check
		- [ ] 

# General

- Take rest with NO internet
	- Reward range
		- Going out -> Pinball
		- Rowing
- Playtime _after_ work
- Acknowledge the limit of concentration time / productivity
	- Push a little bit more day by day
	- Plan accordingly to my limit
- Don't spend too much time on relatively not urgent/important things
	- Notation
	- Perfection of each sentence
- Spend time on whole body
