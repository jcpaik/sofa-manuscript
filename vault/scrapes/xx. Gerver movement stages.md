The main difficulty of analyzing the sofa area functional $\mathcal{A}(K)$ of a cap $K$ is in the area $\left| \mathcal{N}(K) \right|$ of the niche. The niche of Gerver's sofa consists of three curves: the large arc carved out by the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{K_G}(t)$, and the two smaller convex curves with the tangent lines $b_{K_G}(t)$ and $d_{K_G}(t)$ trimming out a small region at the both ends of the large arc.

The points where the sofa and the inner walls touch are marked as dots (so there is no contact when there is no dot). Orange, blue, and yellow colors represent the points of the sofa touching the left inner wall $d_{K_G}(t)$, inner corner $\mathbf{x}_{K_G}(t)$, and right inner wall $b_{K_G}(t)$ respectively. ^fig-gerver-movement-stages

Gerver derived his sofa by assuming _a priori_ that the niche of a sofa of maximum area consists of such three curves. We circumvent the difficulty by considering only the region bounded by the path $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ of the inner corner for all $t \in [0, \pi/2]$, ignoring the area trimmed by $b_{K}(t)$ and $d_{K}(t)$. If the cap $K$ is well-behaved, then the area enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ can be expressed as an integral using Green's theorem. We use this integral to define $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ as the area of $K$ subtracted by the area enclosed by $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$. So for any well-behaved cap $K$, the value $\mathcal{A}_1(K)$ becomes an upper bound of $\mathcal{A}(K)$.
