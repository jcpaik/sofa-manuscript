In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define the right-angled hallway $L$ of unit width as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ where $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ are the horizontal and vertical sides of $L$ respectively. A _sofa_ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that can be moved around the corner from $L_H$ to $L_V$ by a continuous rigid motion inside $L$.

There are two prominent examples of a sofa. One is _Hammersley's sofa_. It consists of two unit radius quarter-circles and a rectangular block of width $4/\pi$ carved out by a semicircular hole (see Figure xx). It has an area of $2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2.2074\cdots$. Another is _Gerver's sofa_. It has an area of $\mu_G = 2.2195\cdots$. 

It has been shown that a sofa of the maximum area $\mu_M$ exists \cite{gerver1992moving}. Gerver also conjectured that his sofa actually attains the maximum area, so that $\mu_M = \mu_G$. However, the exact value of $\mu_M$ is still unknown. The sofa with largest area known so far is that of Gerver's found in 1992 with the area
$$\mu_G = 2.21953166 \cdots.$$
In other direction, the work of Romik and Kallus \cite{kallus2018improved} shows the best upper bound $2.37$ known so far in the literature using an extensive computer-assisted approach. With this, the best bounds on the maximum sofa area can be summarized as the following.
$$\mu_G = 2.2195 \dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37$$

A part of the problem's difficulty is illustrated by the complexity of Gerver's sofa.
Although he derived the sofa by solving for the local optimality of the area, he had to assume five specific stages of the sofa movement _a priori_ to find a workable formula for the area.
The area carved out by the inner corner is challenging.
To this end, the problem is an infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem with no known general formula amenable to tools like functional analysis or convex optimization.

By looking at the movement in the perspective of the sofa, one can see the sofa as the intersection of rotating _hallways_ (see Figure \ref{fig:rotationpath}). In this sense, the problem can be seen as an instance of _inverse Kakeya problem_. Given a a shape $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, what is the largest area of a shape $S$ that can be placed by translation inside any rotations of $L$? Cabello, Cheong and Dobbins have shown that the largest shape $S$ that can be . This problem is easy as the global set is convex. However, as.



In this paper, we describe a line of attack towards the moving sofa problem. We postulate the _injectivity hypothesis_, which states that there is a sofa of maximum area such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of the rotating hallway does not self-intersect.
Under this assumption, we can take account of the area carved out by the inner corner only. This gives an overestimate $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the actual area $\mathcal{A}$. We show that the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area $\mathcal{A}$ is convex.

- Chapter 1 rigorously defines what is a sofa and introduces basic definitions. 
- Chapter 2 shows that we can restrict the position of hallways further. We construct a convex space $\mathcal{K}$ of sofas that contains a sofa of maximum area. The problem becomes the maximization of area functional $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$.
- Chapter 3 introduces the injectivity hypothesis. Assuming the hypothesis, we construct an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$. We show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a positive-definite quadratic functional on $\mathcal{A}_1$. That makes the analysis of maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$. 

In an upcoming manuscript, we plan to prove the injectivity hypothesis using a computer-assisted approach.
