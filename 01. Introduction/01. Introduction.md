In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define the right-angled hallway $L$ of unit width as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ where $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ are the horizontal and vertical sides of $L$ respectively. A _sofa_ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that can be moved around the corner from $L_H$ to $L_V$ by a continuous rigid motion inside $L$. 

Two well-known examples of a sofa are Hammersley's sofa and Gerver's sofa. Hammersley's sofa consists of two unit radius quarter-circles and a rectangular block of width $4/\pi$ carved out by a semicircular hole. It has an area of $2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2.2074\cdots$. On the other hand, Gerver's sofa, which is composed of three straight line segments, four circular arcs, and eleven analytic curves, has an area of $\mu_G = 2.2195\cdots$. Gerver derived his sofa by considering local optimality and conjectured that it has the maximum area possible. His sofa currently holds the record of largest known area.

It is known that a sofa of the maximum area $\mu_M$ exists. However, the exact value of $\mu_M$ is yet unknown. The work of Romik and Kallus shows the best upper bound $2.37$ known so far using an extensive computer-assisted approach. With this, the best known bounds on the maximum sofa area are the following.
$$\mu_G = 2.2195 \dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37$$

By looking at the movement in the perspective of the sofa, one can see the sofa as the intersection of rotating _hallways_ (see Figure \ref{fig:rotationpath}) and two stripes of width 1 representing the horizontal and vertical pathways of the sofa in $L$ before and after rotation. Both Gerver's construction and Romik, Kallus's upper bound are based on this observation. 

The difficulty of finding the exact maximum sofa lies in the complexity of _how_ the hallways intersect. The rotating hallway has multiple sides that interact with each other in intricate ways, thereby influencing which corners or sides of the hallway contribute directly to the shape of the sofa. Consequently, it is not possible to derive a single formula for the area that can be optimized. Indeed, Gerver had to assume five specific stages of the sofa movement _a priori_ to find a workable formula for the area.

In this paper, we present a line of attack towards the moving sofa problem that  circumvents the aforementioned difficulty.

In Chapter 1, we rigorously define what is a sofa and introduce fundamental concepts related to it. Additionally, we state basic geometric results that will be utilized throughout the paper. The proofs of these results are included in Appendix A.

In Chapter 2, we refine the idea that a maximum sofa $S$ is the intersection of rotating hallways $L_t$. By pushing each rotating hallway $L_t$ towards $S$ as much as possible, we can assume that a maximum sofa is a _monotone sofa_ where each $L_t$ always touches the sofa on its outer walls. A monotone sofa $S$ is made up of a cap $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$ subtracted by the niche $N = \mathcal{N}(S)$. The cap $K$ is a convex set with the outer walls of the hallway as tangent lines. The niche $N$ is a union of the triangular wedges that are carved out by inner corners. 

This separates the interactions between inner and outer walls of $L_t$, and makes the interaction of outer walls much simpler. It allows us to focus solely on studying the niche $N$ where the complexity of the intersection lies in.

In Chapter 3, we state the _injectivity hypothesis_, that there is a sofa of maximum area such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of the rotating hallway does not self-intersect. Under this assumption, the area of the region $N_0$ bounded by the inner corner only is a lower bound of the area of the niche $N$. This gives an overestimate $\mathcal{A}_1(S) = |K| - |N_0|$ of the actual area $\mathcal{A}(S) = |K| - |N|$. We show that the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area $\mathcal{A}$ is convex. 

In Chapter 4, we give brief sketches of the ideas on attacking the full Gerver's conjecture, which states that Gerver's sofa indeed attains the maximum area.
- We developed `SofaDesigner`, a program that solves for the intersection of a finite number of .
- How to prove the injectivity theorem using `SofaDesigner`.
- The _structure hypothesis_ and how to proceed after than.
The full details are still ongoing, and will be published after .

- Chapter 3 introduces the injectivity hypothesis. Assuming the hypothesis, we construct an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$. We show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a positive-definite quadratic functional on $\mathcal{A}_1$. That makes the analysis of maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$. 
- Chapter 4 describes future directions of the line of attack. First, we introduce a brief idea of how to prove the injectivity hypothesis. Second, we introduce the _structure hypothesis_ that . The exact details of the ideas will be fleshed out in upcoming manuscripts.

In this sense, the problem can be seen as an instance of _inverse Kakeya problem_: given a shape $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, what is the largest area of the intersection $S$ of translated rotations of $L$?
