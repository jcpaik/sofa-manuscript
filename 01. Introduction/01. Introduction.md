In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define the right-angled hallway $L$ of unit width as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ where $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ are the horizontal and vertical sides of $L$ respectively. A _sofa_ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that can be moved around the corner from $L_H$ to $L_V$ by a continuous rigid motion inside $L$. 

There are two prominent examples of a sofa. One is _Hammersley's sofa_. It consists of two unit radius quarter-circles and a rectangular block of width $4/\pi$ carved out by a semicircular hole. It has an area of $2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2.2074\cdots$. Another is _Gerver's sofa_. It has an area of $\mu_G = 2.2195\cdots$ and currently holds the record of largest known area. Gerver derived his sofa from local optimality considerations, and the sofa consists of 3 straight line segments, 4 circular arcs, and 11 analytic curves. He conjectured that his sofa indeed attains the maximum area.

It is known that a sofa of the maximum area $\mu_M$ exists. However, the exact value of $\mu_M$ is yet unknown. The work of Romik and Kallus shows the best upper bound $2.37$ known so far using an extensive computer-assisted approach. With this, the best known bounds on the maximum sofa area are the following.
$$\mu_G = 2.2195 \dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37$$

By looking at the movement in the perspective of the sofa, one can see the sofa as the intersection of rotating _hallways_ (see Figure \ref{fig:rotationpath}) and two stripes of width 1 representing the horizontal and vertical pathways of the sofa in $L$ before and after rotation. Both Gerver's construction and Romik, Kallus's upper bound relies on. The problem lies in _how_ the hallways intersect. The hallway is not convex, and the many sides of $L$ interact with each other to contribute . Indeed, Gerver had to assume five specific stages of the sofa movement _a priori_ to find a workable formula for the area. Earlier movement affects later .

In this paper, we describe a line of attack towards the moving sofa problem. 

First, we improve upon the idea of the rotating hallway. We observe that each hallway can be pushed down as much as it can, so that its outer walls can be assumed to touch the sofa. After the transformation, a sofa as the intersection of hallways is a cap K minus niche N. The cap K is a convex set with outer walls of hallway as tangent lines. The niche N is the union of triangular wedges carved out by inner corners. Although the interactions of  

Second, 
We state the _injectivity hypothesis_, that there is a sofa of maximum area such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of the rotating hallway does not self-intersect. Under this assumption, we can take account of the area carved out by the inner corner only. This gives an overestimate $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the actual area $\mathcal{A}$. We show that the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the area $\mathcal{A}$ is convex.

- Chapter 1 rigorously defines what is a sofa and introduces basic definitions. 
- Chapter 2 shows that we can restrict the position of hallways further. We construct a convex space $\mathcal{K}$ of sofas that contains a sofa of maximum area. The problem becomes the maximization of area functional $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$.
- Chapter 3 introduces the injectivity hypothesis. Assuming the hypothesis, we construct an upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$. We show that $\mathcal{A}_1$ is a positive-definite quadratic functional on $\mathcal{A}_1$. That makes the analysis of maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$. 
- Chapter 4 describes future directions of the line of attack. First, we introduce a brief idea of how to prove the injectivity hypothesis. Second, we introduce the _structure hypothesis_ that . The exact details of the ideas will be fleshed out in upcoming manuscripts.

In this sense, the problem can be seen as an instance of _inverse Kakeya problem_: given a shape $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, what is the largest area of the intersection $S$ of translated rotations of $L$?
