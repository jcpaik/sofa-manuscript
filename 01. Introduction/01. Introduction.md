In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define the hallway $L$ of unit width as the union $L_H \cup L_V$ where $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ are the horizontal and vertical sides of $L$ respectively. A _sofa_ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that can be moved around the corner from $L_H$ to $L_V$ by a continuous rigid motion inside $L$.

It has been shown that a sofa of the maximum area $\mu_M$ exists \cite{gerver1992moving}. However, the exact value of $\mu_M$ is still unknown. The sofa with largest area known so far is that of Gerver's \cite{gerver1992moving} found in 1992 with the area
$$\mu_G = 2.21953166 \cdots.$$
In other direction, the work of Romik and Kallus \cite{kallus2018improved} shows the best upper bound $2.37$ known so far in the literature using computer-assisted approach. With this, the best bounds on the maximum sofa area can be summarized as the following.
$$\mu_G = 2.2195 \dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37$$

Gerver conjectured that his sofa attains the maximum area, so that $\mu_M = \mu_G$. A part of the problem's difficulty is illustrated by the complexity of Gerver's sofa.
Although he derived the sofa by solving for the local optimality of the area, he had to assume five specific stages of the sofa movement \emph{a priori} to find a workable formula for the area.
To this end, the problem is an infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem with no known general formula amenable to tools like functional analysis or convex optimization.
