In 1966, Leo Moser posed the following _moving sofa problem_.

> What is the planar shape of maximum area that can be moved around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width?

More precisely, define the right-angled hallway $L$ of unit width as the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ where $L_H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and $L_V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ are the horizontal and vertical sides of $L$ respectively. A _sofa_ is a connected, nonempty and compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that can be moved around the corner from $L_H$ to $L_V$ by a continuous rigid motion inside $L$. 

Two well-known examples of a sofa are Hammersley's sofa [[@hammersley1968enfeeblement]] and Gerver's sofa [[@gerverMovingSofaCorner1992]] (see [[#^fig-sofa-examples]] and [[#^fig-gerver-sofa-movement]]). Hammersley's sofa has an area of $2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2.2074\cdots$ and it consists of two unit radius quarter-circles and a rectangular block of width $4/\pi$ carved out by a semicircular hole. On the other hand, Gerver's sofa has a slightly larger area of $\mu_G = 2.2195\cdots$. It has a complicated shape consisting of three straight line segments, four circular arcs, and eleven analytic curves. Gerver derived his sofa by considering local optimality and conjectured that it has the maximum area possible. His sofa currently holds the record of largest known area of a sofa.

It is known that a sofa of the maximum area $\mu_M$ exists. However, the exact value of $\mu_M$ is yet unknown. The work of Romik and Kallus [[@kallusImprovedUpperBounds2018]] shows the best upper bound $2.37$ known so far using an extensive computer-assisted approach. With this, the best known bounds on the maximum sofa area are the following.
$$\mu_G = 2.2195 \dots \leq \mu_M \leq 2.37$$
By looking at the movement in the perspective of the sofa, one can see the sofa as the intersection of rotating _hallways_. Both Gerver's construction and Romik, Kallus's upper bound are based on this observation.

The difficulty of finding the maximum sofa lies in the complexity of _how_ the hallways intersect. Gerver had to assume five specific stages of the sofa movement _a priori_ to derive his sofa ([[01. Introduction#^fig-gerver-movement-stages]]). This assumption determines exactly which corners or sides of the hallway contribute directly to the area, allowing one to find an exact formula of the area that can be maximized. Still, it is hard to prove that the hallways should intersect this way because the set of contact points of each hallway depends mutually on the positions of other hallways.

The points where the sofa and the inner walls touch are marked as dots (this also means that there is no contact when there is no dot). Orange, blue, and yellow colors represent the point touching the horizontal inner wall, inner corner, and vertical inner wall respectively. ^fig-gerver-movement-stages

In this paper, we outline a part of an ongoing attempt to prove the Gerver's conjecture that Gerver's sofa indeed attains the maximum area. We introduce a mathematical statement named the _injectivity hypothesis_. Assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we construct a convex upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1$ of the sofa area with a definite formula. By solving for the maximum value of $\mathcal{A}_1$, we obtain an upper bound $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$ of the sofa area. The proof of injectivity hypothesis will be provided in an upcoming manuscript.

In Section 1, we rigorously define what is a sofa and introduce basic concepts related to it. Additionally, we state fundamental geometric results that will be utilized throughout the paper. The proofs of these results are included in Appendix A.

In Section 2, we refine the idea that a maximum sofa $S$ is the intersection of hallways $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $t$. By pushing each rotating hallway $L_t$ towards $S$ as much as possible, we show that a maximum area sofa can be assumed to be a _monotone sofa_ where each $L_t$ always touches the sofa $S$ on the outer walls (see [[#^fig-monotone-sofa]]). We show that a monotone sofa $S$ has the structure of a cap $K$ subtracted by the niche $N \subseteq K$. The cap $K$ is a convex set with the outer walls of the hallway as tangent lines. The niche $N$ is a union of the triangular wedges carved out by inner corners.

This notion of monotone sofa serves two purposes. First, it makes the interaction of inner and outer walls of rotating hallways much simpler. We can assume that there is no interaction between inner and outer walls, and that the outer walls forms the tangent lines of a convex set. So it suffices to study the niche $N$ where the complexity of the shape is concentrated. Second, we can identify a monotone sofa $S$ with its cap $K$ as both the hallway $L_t$ and the niche $N$ are completely determined by $K$. Under this identification, we show that the space $\mathcal{K}$ of caps can be seen as a convex space containing the set of monotone sofas. So the problem of maximizing the sofa area becomes the problem of maximizing the area functional $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ sending $K$ to the area of the monotone sofa with cap $K$. As $\mathcal{A}$ has a convex domain the maximization of $\mathcal{A}$ becomes easier.

In Section 3, we state the _injectivity hypothesis_, that there is a sofa of maximum area such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}(t)$ of the rotating hallway does not self-intersect. Under this assumption, the area of the region $N_0$ bounded by the inner corner only is a lower bound of the area of the niche $N$. This gives an overestimate $\mathcal{A}_1(K) = |K| - |\mathcal{N}_0(K)|$ of the actual area $\mathcal{A}(S) = |K| - |N|$. We show that the upper bound $\mathcal{A}_1 : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ of the area $\mathcal{A} : \mathcal{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ is convex. This is done by using Mamikon's theorem. We briefly sketch on our plan to show the injectivity hypothesis using a computer-assisted approach.

In Section 4, we outline a prospected proof of the injectivity hypothesis.

We briefly sketch the followings in Section 4.
- How we plan to show the injectivity hypothesis using computer assistance. 
- How we plan to capture the complexity of shape type of Gerver's sofa demonstrated in [[01. Introduction#^fig-gerver-movement-stages]]. We argue that 

In Chapter 4, we provide brief outlines of our planned approach to tackle Gerver's conjecture, which asserts that Gerver's sofa indeed achieves the maximum area. 
- We begin by presenting a strategy for proving the injectivity theorem, which we have developed using `SofaDesigner`, a software that aids in the proof. 
- Additionally, we introduce the _structure hypothesis_ and explain how it can be utilized to establish an upper bound that matches the area of Gerver's sofa. 
We present these ideas to demonstrate our contributions to the problem and to illustrate how our current work fits into the larger context of existing research. We note that this article is subject to modifications or possible failure of the attack as our research progresses.

In this sense, the problem can be seen as an instance of _inverse Kakeya problem_: given a shape $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, what is the largest area of the intersection $S$ of translated rotations of $L$?
