This section defines necessary tools for _convex bodies_ in a plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. We adopt the definition of a convex body as the intersection of half-planes.

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is an intersection of half-planes (see [[01. Geometry Definitions#^def-half-plane]]). ^def-convex-body

# Support Function

Refer to the definition of support functions, tangent lines and half-planes in [[01. Geometry Definitions]]. Along with this we have a definition of the edges of $K$.

> __Theorem [support-function-lipschitz].__ For any convex body $K$, its support function $p_K$ is Lipschitz. Moreover, if $K$ is inside the closed ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin, then $p_K$ is $R$-Lipschitz. ^thm-support-function-lipschitz

_Proof._ (sketch) Support function $p_K$ is the supremum of sine functions generated from each point of $K$. Each sine function has an amplitude of $\leq R$. So the supremum of all such functions is $R$-Lipschitz as well. □

# Vertices

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the edge $e_K(t)$ as the intersection $l_K(t) \cap K$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Definition [boundary].__ For any subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the bondary of $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as $\partial S$. ^def-boundary

> __Theorem [boundary-is-union-all-edges].__ The boundary $\partial K$ of any convex body $K$ is the union ^thm-boundary-is-union-all-edges
$$
\partial K = \bigcup_{t \in S^1} e_K(t)
$$
> of all the edges of $K$.

_Proof._ (sketch) $\partial K \supseteq e_K(t)$ for any $t \in S^1$ is easy. Take any point $p \in \partial K$. If $p$ strictly lie inside the interior of the half-plane $H_K(t)$ for any $t \in S^1$, then $p$ is in the interior of $K$ as well. So $p$ is in $l_K(t)$ for some $t$. □

> __Lemma [convex-body-vertex-lemma].__ For any convex body $K$ and angle $t \in S^1$, the set $e_K(t)$ is a closed line segment because it is a nonempty, bounded, convex and closed subset of $l_K(t)$. So any point $p$ of $e_K(t)$ can be represented as $p = p_K(t)u_t + \alpha v_t$ for some $\alpha$ that spans over some closed interval. ^lem-convex-body-vertex-lemma

> __Definition [convex-body-vertex].__ Under the same assumption as [[#^lem-convex-body-vertex-lemma]], let $v^+_K(t)$ be such a $p$ with the largest value of $\alpha$, and let $v_K^-(t)$ be such a $p$ with the smallest value of $\alpha$. Any of $v_K^+(t)$ or $v_K^-(t)$ are called the _vertices_ of $K$. ^def-convex-body-vertex

> __Corollary [edge-as-vertex-segment].__ By [[#^lem-convex-body-vertex-lemma]] the edge $e_K(t)$ is the closed line segment connecting $v_K^-(t)$ and $v_K^+(t)$. ^cor-edge-as-vertex-segment

Next, we are going to show that $v_K^+(t)$ is right-continuous with respect to $t$ and that $p_K(t)$ is both left and right-differentiable. The following lemma is the hard/technical part for computing limits.

> __Lemma [limits-converging-to-vertex].__ Let $K$ be a convex body and $t$ be an arbitrary angle. We have the following limits all converging to $v_K^+(t)$. ^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex
$$
\lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^+(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } l_K(u) \cap l_K(t) = v_K^+(t)
$$

_Proof._ TODO: fix the name collision $l = l(t', h')$. The proof itself is complete.

![[vertex-right-continuous.jpeg|400]]

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Let $p = v_K^+(t) + \epsilon v_t$. Then by [[#^cor-edge-as-vertex-segment]] the point $p$ is not in $K$. As $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus K$ is open, any sufficiently small open neighborhood of $p$ is disjoint from $K$, so we can take some positive $\epsilon' < \epsilon$ such that the closed line segment connecting $p$ and $q = p - \epsilon' u_t$ is not in $K$ as well.

Now consider the line $l$ that passes through both $q$ and $v_K^+(t)$. By the definition of $q = v_K^+(t) - \epsilon' u_t + \epsilon v_t$, we have $l = l(t', h')$ for some $t' \in (t, t + \pi/2)$ and $h' \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $x = v_K^+(t) \cdot v_t$. Let $H' = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus H^\circ(t', h')$. Define a triangular region $T$ as the intersection $T = H_K(t) \cap H' \cap H(t + \pi/2, x + \epsilon)$. 

We will show that $K$ intersected with $H'$ is trapped inside a small triangular region $T$.

First, $K \cap H'$ is in $H_K(t) \cap H'$ by definition of $H_K(t)$. Next, assume by contradiction that there is $r \in K \cap H$ such that $r$ is also not in $l(t + \pi/2, x + \epsilon)$. Then we have $r \cdot v_t > x + \epsilon$. As both $r$ and $v_K^+(t)$ are in $K \cap H'$, we find a middle point $s$ between $r$ and $v_K^+(t)$ such that $s \cdot v_t = x + \epsilon$ and such that $s \in K \cap H'$. As $s$ is on the line $l(t + \pi/2, x+\epsilon)$ and in $H_K(t) \cap H'$, $s$ is on the line segment connecting $p$ and $q$. But then this contradicts the assumption.

So for any angle $u \in (t, t')$, the edge $e_K(u)$ should lie inside the triangular region $T$.

In the fan $H_K(t) \cap H(t', h')$, the vertex $z = v_K^+(t)$ attains the maximum of $z \cdot u_t$. All other competitors are in $T$, so the maximize $z$ of $z \cdot u_t$ lies in $T$ either way.

Observe that $T$ contains $v_K^+(t)$ and the diameter of $T$ is $< 2\epsilon$. So both endpoints $v_K^+(u)$ and $v_K^-(u)$ are distance $< 2\epsilon$ away from $v_K^+(t)$. This completes the epsilon-delta argument for $\lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^+(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = v_K^+(t)$. Also, note that $l_K(u) \cap l_K(t)$ is inside $T$ as well, so we also show $\lim_{ u \to t^+ } l_K(u) \cap l_K(t) = v_K^+(t)$.  □

An immediate corollary is:

> __Theorem [vertex-right-continuous].__ For any convex body $K$, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is a right-continuous function on $t \in S^1$. ^thm-vertex-right-continuous

_Proof._ Exactly the first limit of [[#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]]. □

> __Theorem [vertex-monotone].__ Let $K$ be any convex body. Let $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ be any angle. On the interval $t \in [t_0, t_0 + \pi]$, the value $v_K^+(t) \cdot u_t$ is monotonically decreasing. On the interval $t \in [t_0 - \pi, t_0]$, the value $v_K^+(t) \cdot u_t$ is monotonically increasing. ^thm-vertex-monotone

_Proof._ (sketch) Reduces to rudimentary epsilon-delta and trigonometry. First use the value $l_K(u) \cap l_K(t)$ in [[#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]] to reduce to the intersection points of actual tangent lines, then use the rudimentary trigonometry with convexity. □

> __Theorem [vertex-bounded-variation].__ On any bounded interval $t \in I$ of $\mathbb{R}$, $v_K^+(t)$ is of bounded variation. So $v_K^+(t)$ is locally of bounded-variation. ^thm-vertex-bounded-variation

_Proof._ (sketch) Both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $v_K^+(t)$ repeats monotonically increasing/decreasing back and forth with an interval of $\pi$. Use bounded-variation on the intervals $[0, \pi/2]$, $[\pi/2, \pi]$, $[\pi, 3\pi/2]$, $[3\pi/2, 2\pi]$ and repeat with periodicity $2\pi$. □

We now move on to the left/right differentiability of $p_K(t)$.

> __Definition [left-right-differentiation].__ For any function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on some open subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $t \in X$, define $\partial^+f(t)$ and $\partial^-f(t)$ as the right and left differentiation of $f$ at $t$ if they exists. ^def-left-right-differentiation

We use the following calculation.

> __Lemma [intersection-tangent-lines].__ Let $t, t' \in S^1$ be arbitrary with $t' = t + \theta$ for $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi) \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Then the intersection $l_{K}(t) \cap l_K(t')$ is a point and it is exactly the following.  ^lem-intersection-tangent-lines
$$
l_{K}(t) \cap l_K(t') = p_K(t) u_{t} + \alpha_K(t, t + \theta) v_{t}
$$
> Here, the value $\alpha_K(t, t + \theta)$ is defined as the following.
$$
\alpha_K(t, t + \theta) = \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
$$

_Proof._ Because the point $p = l_{K}(t) \cap l_K(t')$ is on the line $l_K(t)$, we have $p = p_K(t) u_{t} + \alpha v_{t}$
for some constant $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. We use $p \cdot u_{t'} = p_K(t')$ to derive the unique value $\alpha$.
$$
\begin{align*}
p_K(t') &= p_K(t) (u_{t} \cdot u_{t'}) + \alpha (v_{t} \cdot u_{t'}) \\
&= p_K(t) \cos \theta + \alpha \sin \theta
\end{align*}
$$
This gives $\alpha = p_C(t') \csc \theta - p_C(t) \cot \theta$ and completes the proof. □

Using the calculation we show both the following theorems at once.

> __Theorem [support-function-left-right-differentiable].__ For any convex body $K$, $p_K$ is both left and right differentiable. ^thm-support-function-left-right-differentiable

> __Theorem [vertex-formula].__ For any convex body $K$ and angle $t \in S^1$, the following equalities hold.
$$v_K^+(t) = p_K(t)u_t + \partial^+p_K(t)v_t$$
$$v_K^-(t) = p_K(t)u_t + \partial_-p_K(t)v_t.$$
 ^thm-vertex-formula

_Proof._ We show the first equality. (TODO: add proof for the second equality)
The last limit of [[^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]] and [[#^lem-intersection-tangent-lines]] shows that we have the following.
$$
\begin{align}
v_K^+(t) & = p_K(t)u_t + \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ }  \alpha_K(t, \theta)v_t
\end{align}
$$
Computing the limit,
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ }  \alpha_K(t, \theta) & = \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ } \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \\
& = \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ } \left( \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t)}{\theta} + p_K(t) \frac{1- \cos \theta}{ \theta } \right) \cdot \frac{\theta}{\sin \theta} \\
& = \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ } \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t)}{\theta}  \\
& = \partial^+p_K(t)
\end{align} 
$$
as $(1 - \cos \theta)/\theta \to 0$ and $\theta / \sin \theta \to 1$ as $\theta \to 0$. □

> __Corollary [right-differentiation-right-continuous].__ For any convex body $K$, $\partial^+ p_K$ is right-continuous. ^cor-right-differentiation-right-continuous

_Proof._ By [[#^thm-vertex-right-continuous]] and [[#^thm-vertex-formula]] we have $p_K(t)u_t + \partial^+p_K(t)v_t$ right-continuous. $p_K(t)$ is continuous by [[#^thm-support-function-lipschitz]]. So subtracting and taking the dot product with continuous $v_t$ we get that $\partial^+ p_K$ is right-continuous. □

> __Corollary [right-differentiation-locally-bounded-variation].__  For any convex body $K$, $\partial^+ p_K$ is locally bounded-variation. ^cor-right-differentiation-locally-bounded-variation

_Proof._ Use that $v_K^+(t) = p_K(t)u_t + \partial^+p_K(t)v_t$ is [[#^thm-vertex-bounded-variation|locally bounded variation]] and that $p_K$ is [[#^thm-support-function-lipschitz|Lipschitz]]. □

This is a version of the fundamental theorem of calculus for the support function.

> __Corollary [integral-of-right-differentiation].__ For any convex body $K$ and any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a < b$, we have the following. ^cor-integral-of-right-differentiation
$$
p_K(b) - p_K(a) = \int_{(a, b]} \partial^+p_K(t)\,dt
$$
> Consequently, $dp_K(t) = \partial^+p_K(t) dt$.

_Proof._ As $p_K$ is Lipschitz by [[#^thm-support-function-lipschitz]], $p_K$ is also absolutely continuous. This [means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_continuity) that the derivative of $p_k$ exists almost everywhere, and by definition it should be equal to $\partial^+p_K$. By absolute continuity we then get the claimed equation. □

# Parametrization of Tangents from Intersections of Tangents

> __Theorem [parametrize-tangent-line-with-intersections].__ For any convex body $K$ and $t \in S^1$, the point $l_K(t - \theta) \cap l_K(t)$ absolutely-continuously parametrizes the open ray from $v_K^-(t)$ in the direction $-v_t$ for $\theta \in (-\pi, 0)$. Using continuity it can be extended to $\theta \in(-\pi, 0]$. The map might not be injective. ^thm-parametrize-tangent-line-with-intersections
