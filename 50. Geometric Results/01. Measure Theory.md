If $\mu$ is a Borel measure on an interval $I$ of $\mathbb{R}$, and $X$ is a measurable subset of $I$, denote the Lebesgue integral of a measurable function $f$ on $X$ as $\int_{X}f\,d \mu$ (no parametrization) or $\int_X f(t)\,\mu(dt)$ (parametrization with $t \in X$). If the name of the measure $\mu = dF$ starts with letter $d$ (used to denote that it is a 'differential' of some function $F$), then instead of writing $\int_X f\,d(dF)$ we just write $\int_X f\,dF$. Also instead of writing $\int_X f(t)\, dF(dt)$ we write $\int_X f(t)\,dF(t)$. The notation $\int_a^b f(t) \, \mu(dt)$ means the integral $\int_{(a, b]} f(t)\,\mu(dt)$. That is, $\int_a^b$ denotes the integration on the half-open interval $(a, b]$.

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes-measure].__ For any right-continuous, bounded-variation function $F : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on any interval $I$ (open, closed, half-open, finite, infinite, etc.) there is a unique signed Borel measure $dF$ called the _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ on $I$ such that $dF\left( (a, b] \right) = F(b) - F(a)$ for any interval $(a, b]$ in $I$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes-measure

We will try to justify the calculation of differentials, like $d(f + g) = df + dg$ or $d(fg) = df \cdot g + f \cdot dg$. Linearity holds.

> __Theorem [lebesgue-stieltjes-measure-linear].__ For any right-continuous, bounded-variation functions $F, G : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on any interval $I$, $d(c_1 F + c_2 G) = c_1 dF + c_2 dG$ for any constants $c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. ^thm-lebesgue-stieltjes-measure-linear

But we don't have $d(FG) = dF \cdot G + F \cdot dG$ in general. For an example, assume that both $F$ and $G$ are functions $1_{\geq 0}$. Then $FG = 1_{\geq0}$ as well, but we have $d(1_{\geq0})$ equal to the Dirac measure $\delta$ with mass 1 concentrated at zero, so $d(FG) = \delta$ while $dF \cdot G + F \cdot dG = 2 \delta$. Therefore, some care has to be made.

> __Definition [left-right-limit].__ For any single-variable, real-value function $f$, $f(t-)$ denotes the left limit of $f$ at $t$ and $f(t+)$ denotes the right limit of $f$ at $t$. ^def-left-right-limit

> __Theorem [bounded-variation-left-right-limit].__ If $f$ is a bounded-variation function on $I \to \mathbb{R}$, then for any $t \in I$ the left and right limits $f(t-)$ and $f(t+)$ both exists. ^thm-bounded-variation-left-right-limit

> __Theorem [integration-by-parts].__ Let $F, G : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be right-continuous and bounded-variation functions. Then we have the following. ^thm-integration-by-parts
$$
F(b)G(b) = F(a)G(a) + \int_{(a, b]} F(t) \, dG(t) + \int_{(a, b]} G(t-) \, dF(t)
$$

_Proof._ A possible reference is [this](https://www.math.utah.edu/~li/L-S%20integral.pdf). □

> __Corollary [product-rule-differential].__ Let $F, G : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be right-continuous and bounded-variation on some interval $I$. If either $F$ or $G$ is continuous, then we do have $d(FG) = F dG + G dF$. ^cor-product-rule-differential

_Proof._ Assume $G$ is continuous. By [Carathéodory's extension theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem) it is sufficient to justify that the measure of both $d(FG)$ and $FdG + GdF$ agrees on any $(a, b] \subseteq I$. Using the definitions and that $G(t-) = G(t)$ this is exactly [[#^thm-integration-by-parts]]. If $F$ is continuous we can just flip the roles of $F$ and $G$. □
