Let $\Theta$ be a finite set of angles such that $\{0, \pi/2\} \subseteq \Theta \subseteq [0, \pi/2]$. That is, $\Theta$ is a partition
$$0 = \theta_0 < \theta_1 < \theta_2 < \cdots < \theta_n = \pi/2$$
of the interval $[0, \pi/2]$. The task of `SofaDesigner` is to compute the set of all _monotone hallway intersections_ $S$ with the set of angles $\Theta$ and an area at least $2.2195\dots$. Essentially, $S$ is a polygonal intersection of the hallways of width 1 rotated by each angle of $\Theta$.

# Definition of $S$

We first recall the precise definition and shape of a monotone hallway intersection $S$ with angle set $\Theta$. All the details in this section is important.

$H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ is the horizontal strip of height 1. $L$ is the right-angled hallway of width 1, with inner corner at $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and outer corner at $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$. Mathematically, $L = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1] \cup [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$. Let $a$ and $b$ be the lines $x=1$ and $y=1$ passing through the outer corner $\mathbf{y}$ representing the outer walls of $L$. Let $c$ and $d$ be the half-lines $(-\infty, 0] \times \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0 \right\} \times (-\infty, 0]$ emanating from the inner corner $\mathbf{x}$ representing the inner walls of $L$. For any $0 \leq i \leq n$, let $L_i$ be a copy of the hallway $L$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\theta_i$ and translated so that the inner corner is positioned at $\mathbf{x}_i$. Let $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ and $d_i$ be the sides of the hallway $L_i$ corresponding to the sides $a, b, c,$ and $d$ of $L$.

Without loss of generality, we assume that $L_0 = L$ so that $\mathbf{x}_0 = (0, 0)$. Also, we assume that $\mathbf{x}_n$ has the $y$-coordinate equal to zero.

The monotone hallway intersection $S$ is the intersection of the horizontal strip $H$ and the hallways $L_i$. Moreover, the sides $y=0$ and $y=1$ of $H$ and the outer walls $a_i$ and $c_i$ of $L_i$ for any $0 \leq i \leq n$ should determine all the sides of a convex polygon $K$ called the _cap_ of $S$. The sides $a_n$ and $c_0$ are equal to the line $y=1$ and determines the upper horizontal edge of $K$ (this is a consequence of $\mathbf{x}_0 = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{x}_n$ having $y$-coordinate zero.). The sides $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}$ forms the different edge of $K$ on the right side in counterclockwise order, and the sides $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ forms the different edges of $K$ on the right side in counterclockwise order. Although we allow some edges of $K$ to degenerate and have zero length, the lines should touch $K$.

For any $0 < i \leq n$, let $A_i$ be the intersection of $a_{i-1}$ and $a_i$. Also let $A_0$ be the intersection of $a_0$ and the line $y=0$. Likewise, for any $0 \leq i < n$, let $C_i$ be the intersection of $c_i$ and $c_{i+1}$. Also let $C_n$ be the intersection of $a_0$ and the line $y=0$. Then the points $A_0, A_1, \dots, A_n$ forms the vertices of $K$ on the right side, and the points $C_0, C_1, \dots, C_n$ forms the vertices of $K$ on the left side.


consists of a cap $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ subtracted by the niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$ bounded by a polyline.

Given a linear functional $f$ on $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$, `SofaDesigner` will be able to calculate an upper/lower bound of $f$ on $\mathcal{S}$. It will be used extensively to prove theorems like injectivity theorem.

A monotone hallway intersection $S$ is completely determined by its cap $K$. The state of $S$ can be described in any of the following three equivalent ways.

- The corners $\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n$ of the hallways with following constraints.
	- 
- The support function values $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ and $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n$ of the right and left part of the cap.

Now the cap $K$ can be parametrized by a finite number of variables. 

The space $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$ is finite-dimensional. An $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ can be expressed in terms of any of the following coordinate systems.
- The support function values $p_i = p(\theta_i)$ on $\Theta$.
- The edge lengths $b_i = \beta_K(\left\{ \theta_i \right\}) \geq 0$ of the upper boundary of $\delta K$.
- The coordinates of the inner corners $\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}_K(\theta_i)$.
Now each coordinate system constrainted by the following linear equalities and inequalities correspond one-to-one to the space $\mathcal{K}_\Theta$.
- 
$\mathcal{K}_\Theta^0$ is the normalized space.

Any $K \in \mathcal{K}_\Theta$ is free to translate horizontally. With this, we assume $p_0 = 0$.



- IDEA: provide a format for theorems proved by `SofaDesigner`: 
	- `Verify(theta, ineq)` is true by computation X.
- How does SofaDesigner do this?
	- The formula of a sofa is determined by its polyline.
		- Omit the formal proof.
	- Once a polyline is determined, the problem is a quadratic programming problem.
	- SofaDesigner branches the space of polygon intersections 
		- Either A <= B or A >= B, so it is guaranteed that no space is being wasted
	- As the nodes are branched, the polyline becomes more apparent
		- ANY polyline starting with left ray, some edges in middle, followed by the right ray provides a subset of the niche.
		- ...given that they SHOULD appear in that order.
	- If the upper bound < sofa area, then we cut the node because it has no possibility.
	- 
- Verifying SofaDesigner
	- Nodes: each split does not omit any nodes
	- Ensure that the vertices do appear in that order
	- Every node gives rise to a concave area formula

TODO: change the coordinates to support value $p$ instead of $b$?
- May help boost speedup
- Needs programming time
- 

- Nondegeneracy: We don't want any perturbation of sofas to break into two chunks. That way, we can guarantee that our intersection is _balanced_.
	- This needs verification via software.
- 
- It can be said that `SofaDesinger` captures the global information of how a maximum sofa should behave.
	- Remark: Romik-Kallus essentially show that if we increase the number of angles, it will provide finer upper bound approaching the actual value.


In short, the previous chapters have shown that a sofa is essentially the intersection of rotated hallways. Instead of fixing the hallway $L$ and moving the sofa $S$ inside $L$, we can fix the sofa $S$ and see the movement in the point of view of $S$ so that $L$ is rotating while containing the sofa $S$. Note also that $S$ has to be contained in the horizontal strip $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ so that it can be moved freely around a straight hallway as well. So the problem of maximizing the area of a sofa is to maximize the area of the intersection of all rotating hallways and the horizontal strip $H$.

The aim of the software `SofaDesigner` is to maximize the hallway intersection of the strip $H$ and a finite number of hallways $L_1, L_2, \dots, L_n$ rotated counterclockwise by a predetermined, finite set of angles $\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_n$.

We describe what exactly is a hallway intersection and specify what `SofaDesigner` does. 

The set of all hallway intersections is given by the state $(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n)$, and the set of all states that gives a valid hallway intersection forms a _convex polytope_ inside . That is, a region described by a finite number of inequalities.

# Goals of `SofaDesigner`

We would like to analyze the region where $S$ is at least the area of Gerver's sofa. 

# Combinatorial Arrangement of Hallways

Any intersection or union of polygons are polygons. Moreover, the order of which edges appears in the edges hold importance as well. We denote this as the _combinatorial type_ of ...

Questions:
- How to make them verify a QP?

There are multiple ways to verify a QP:
- Supply certificate for a predetermined value / polynomials
	- Fastest. But would love to have other ways to formulate the problem and verify as well!

Program:
- uses _edge lengths_ as the primitive variables, and represent all the other variables as a formula for it.
	- Advantage: them >= 0 is a valid condition for already.
	- 
- Also, no condition of x(i) being inside the cap has been imposed, which is fortunate.
