The collection of inequalities that we use is fixed. It consists of: $p_{i, j}$ being on the left or right side of $\mathbf{x}_k$, or $p_{i, j}$ being on top or bottom of the line $l_{k}$. 

Each node contains _frontline_. That is, which sequence of lines are guaranteed to form the boundary of a subset of the niche. 
For this, one suffice to prove that all the vertices 

Each leaf node is then divided into two classes. One is when it
