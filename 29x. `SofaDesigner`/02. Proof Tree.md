The root node is simply the set of all caps with support in $\Theta$. Each node is split into two subnodes with respect to an inequality or its negation. With this restriction it is guaranteed that inspecting only the leaf nodes suffice to check the set of all caps.

The collection of inequalities that we use is fixed. It consists of: $p_{i, j}$ being on the left or right side of $\mathbf{x}_k$, or $p_{i, j}$ being on top or bottom of the line $l_{k}$. 

Each node contains _frontline_. That is, which sequence of lines are guaranteed to form the boundary of a subset of the niche. 
For this, one suffice to prove that all the vertices 

Each leaf node is then divided into two classes. One is when it
