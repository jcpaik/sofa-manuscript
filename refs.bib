  abstract = {A necessary condition is given for a region of the plane to have the greatest possible area of any region able to move around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width. A region is constructed, with area 2.2195...and bounded by 18 analytic pieces, which satisfies this condition. It is conjectured that this is the unique region of maximum area.},

  abstract = {The moving sofa problem, posed by L. Moser in 1966, asks for the planar shape of maximal area that can move around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width. It is known that a maximal area shape exists, and that its area is at least 2.2195... - the area of an explicit construction found by Gerver in 1992 - and at most \$2\textbackslash sqrt\{2\}=2.82...\$, with the lower bound being conjectured as the true value. We prove a new and improved upper bound of 2.37. The method involves a computer-assisted proof scheme that can be used to rigorously derive further improved upper bounds that converge to the correct value.},

  abstract = {The moving sofa problem, posed by Moser in 1966, asks for the planar shape of maximal area that can move around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width and is conjectured to have as its solution a complicated shape derived by Gerver in 1992. We extend Gerver’s techniques by deriving a family of six differential equations arising from the area-maximization property. We then use this result to derive a new shape that we propose as a possible solution to the ambidextrous moving sofa problem, a variant of the problem previously studied by Conway and others in which the shape is required to be able to negotiate a right-angle turn both to the left and to the right. Unlike Gerver’s construction, our new shape can be expressed in closed form, and its boundary is a piecewise algebraic curve. Its area is equal to X + arctan Y , where X and Y are solutions to the cubic equations x2(x + 3) = 8 and x(4x2 + 3) = 1, respectively.},
