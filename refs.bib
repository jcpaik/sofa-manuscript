  abstract = {We study the problem of maximizing the overlap of two convex polytopes under translation in Rd for some constant d⩾3. Let n be the number of bounding hyperplanes of the polytopes. We present an algorithm that, for any {$\varepsilon>$}0, finds an overlap at least the optimum minus {$\varepsilon$} and reports the translation realizing it. The running time is O(n{$\lfloor$}d/2{$\rfloor$}+1logdn) with probability at least 1-n-O(1), which can be improved to O(nlog3.5n) in R3. The time complexity analysis depends on a bounded incidence condition that we enforce with probability one by randomly perturbing the input polytopes. The perturbation causes an additive error {$\varepsilon$}, which can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the perturbation magnitude. Our algorithm in fact computes the maximum overlap of the perturbed polytopes. The running time bounds, the probability bound, and the big-O constants in these bounds are independent of {$\varepsilon$}.},

  abstract = {The moving sofa problem, posed by Moser in 1966, asks for the planar shape of maximal area that can move around a right-angled corner in a hallway of unit width and is conjectured to have as its solution a complicated shape derived by Gerver in 1992. We extend Gerver's techniques by deriving a family of six differential equations arising from the area-maximization property. We then use this result to derive a new shape that we propose as a possible solution to the ambidextrous moving sofa problem, a variant of the problem previously studied by Conway and others in which the shape is required to be able to negotiate a right-angle turn both to the left and to the right. Unlike Gerver's construction, our new shape can be expressed in closed form, and its boundary is a piecewise algebraic curve. Its area is equal to X + arctan Y , where X and Y are solutions to the cubic equations x2(x + 3) = 8 and x(4x2 + 3) = 1, respectively.},
