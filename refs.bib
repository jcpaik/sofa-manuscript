In 1995, Seymour conjectured that for any oriented graph D there exists a vertex x such that d+(x) ≤ d++(x). In 2006, Sullivan conjectured that there exists a vertex x in D such that d−(x) ≤ d++(x). We give a sufficient condition in terms of the number of transitive triangles for an oriented graph to satisfy Sullivan’s conjecture. In particular, this implies that Sullivan’s conjecture holds for all orientations of planar graphs and of triangle-free graphs. An oriented graph D is an oriented split graph if the vertices of D can be partitioned into vertex sets X and Y such that X is an independent set and Y induces a tournament. We also show that the two conjectures hold for some families of oriented split graphs, in particular, when Y induces a regular or an almost regular tournament.},

Motivated by this result, we construct five-dimensional reflexive polytopes with the lowest number of vertices and points. By calculating the normal form of the polytopes, we establish that many of these are not in existing datasets and therefore give rise to new Calabi-Yau four-folds. In some instances, the Hodge numbers we compute are new as well.},

In other words, they minimize energy for every potential function that is a completely monotonic function of squared distance (for example, inverse power laws or Gaussians), which is a strong form of robustness not previously known for any configuration in more than one dimension. This theorem implies their recently shown optimality as sphere packings, and broadly generalizes it to allow for longrange interactions. The proof uses sharp linear programming bounds for energy. To construct the optimal auxiliary functions used to attain these bounds, we prove a new interpolation theorem, which is of independent interest. It reconstructs a radial Schwartz function f from the√values and radial derivatives of f and its Fourier transform f at the radii 2n for integers n ≥ 1 in R8 and n ≥ 2 in R24. To prove this theorem, we construct an interpolation basis using integral transforms of quasimodular forms, generalizing Viazovska’s work on sphere packing and placing it in the context of a more conceptual theory.},

This method extends to other examples of convex geometries. We sketch these applications, replicating an earlier result of Gordon, and proving a new result related to ordered sets.},

The strategy is based on estimates of the areas of Delaunay triangles. Our strategy reduces the pentagonal ice-ray conjecture to area minimization problems that involve at most four Delaunay triangles. These minimization problems are solved by computer. The computer-assisted portions of the proof use techniques such as interval arithmetic, automatic differentiation, and a meet-in-the-middle algorithm.},

This conjecture is still open. We formulate the Reinhardt Conjecture as a problem in optimal control theory. The smoothed octagon is a Pontryagin extremal trajectory with bang-bang control. More generally, the smoothed regular \$6k+2\$-gon is a Pontryagin extremal with bang-bang control. The smoothed octagon is a strict (micro) local minimum to the optimal control problem. The optimal solution to the Reinhardt problem is a trajectory without singular arcs. The extremal trajectories that do not meet the singular locus have bang-bang controls with finitely many switching times. Finally, we reduce the Reinhardt problem to an optimization problem on a five-dimensional manifold. (Each point on the manifold is an initial condition for a potential Pontryagin extremal lifted trajectory.) We suggest that the Reinhardt conjecture might eventually be fully resolved through optimal control theory. Some proofs are computer-assisted using a computer algebra system.},

I present a technique for computing Heesch numbers of nontiling polyforms using a SAT solver, and the results of exhaustive computation of Heesch numbers up to 19-ominoes, 17-hexes, and 24-iamonds.},

  abstract = {One of the earliest results in Combinatorics is Mantel’s theorem from 1907 that the largest triangle-free graph on a given vertex set is complete bipartite. However, a seemingly similar question posed by Tur´an in 1941 is still open: what is the largest 3-uniform hypergraph on a given vertex set with no tetrahedron? This question can be considered a test case for the general hypergraph Tur´an problem, where given an r-uniform hypergraph F , we want to determine the maximum number of edges in an r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices that does not contain a copy of F . To date there are very few results on this problem, even asymptotically. However, recent years have seen a revitalisation of this field, via significant developments in the available methods, notably the use of stability (approximate structure) and flag algebras. This article surveys the known results and methods, and discusses some open problems.},

However that finite number remains large, even if modern computers can do it. The method of analysis is classical: to each sphere of an arbitrary packing is associated a corresponding large enough “associated domain”, disjoint from all other similar domains, in the hope of obtaining an interesting upper limit of the space occupation coefficient. Many methods of association have been tried in the past and the new method presented in this study is complex, but very well adapted to the problem of interest.},

We extend Gerver’s techniques by deriving a family of six differential equations arising from the area-maximization property. We then use this result to derive a new shape that we propose as a possible solution to the ambidextrous moving sofa problem, a variant of the problem previously studied by Conway and others in which the shape is required to be able to negotiate a right-angle turn both to the left and to the right. Unlike Gerver’s construction, our new shape can be expressed in closed form, and its boundary is a piecewise algebraic curve. Its area is equal to X + arctan Y , where X and Y are solutions to the cubic equations x2(x + 3) = 8 and x(4x2 + 3) = 1, respectively.},

  abstract = {A famous result by Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s and Szekeres (1935) asserts that, for all \$k,d \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{N\}\$, there is a smallest integer \$n = g\^\{(d)\}(k)\$ such that every set of at least \$n\$ points in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ in general position contains a \$k\$-gon, that is, a subset of \$k\$ points which is in convex position. In this article, we present a SAT model based on acyclic chirotopes (oriented matroids) to investigate Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s--Szekeres numbers in small dimensions. To solve the SAT instances we use modern SAT solvers and all our unsatisfiability results are verified using DRAT certificates. We show \$g\^\{(3)\}(7) = 13\$, \$g\^\{(4)\}(8) \textbackslash le 13\$, and \$g\^\{(5)\}(9) \textbackslash le 13\$, which are the first improvements for decades. For the setting of \$k\$-holes (i.e., \$k\$-gons with no other points in the convex hull), where \$h\^\{(d)\}(k)\$ denotes the minimum number \$n\$ such that every set of at least \$n\$ points in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ in general position contains a \$k\$-hole, we show \$h\^\{(3)\}(7) \textbackslash le 14\$, \$h\^\{(4)\}(8) \textbackslash le 13\$, and \$h\^\{(5)\}(9) \textbackslash le 13\$. Moreover, all obtained bounds are sharp in the setting of acyclic chirotopes and we conjecture them to be sharp also in the original setting of point sets. As a byproduct, we verify previously known bounds. In particular, we present the first computer-assisted proof of the upper bound \$h\^\{(2)\}(6)\textbackslash le g\^\{(2)\}(9) \textbackslash le 1717\$ by Gerken (2008).},

We use computer assistance to show that every set of 17 points in general position admits two disjoint 5-holes, that is, holes with disjoint respective convex hulls. This answers a question of Hosono and Urabe (2001). We also provide new bounds for three and more pairwise disjoint holes. In a recent article, Hosono and Urabe (2018) present new results on interior-disjoint holes -- a variant, which also has been investigated in the last two decades. Using our program, we show that every set of 15 points contains two interior-disjoint 5-holes. Moreover, our program can be used to verify that every set of 17 points contains a 6-gon within significantly smaller computation time than the original program by Szekeres and Peters (2006). Another independent verification of this result was done by Mari\textbackslash 'c (2019).},

To our best knowledge, prior to this work there was no known algorithm in the literature except a trivial brute force algorithm. Our algorithm runs in time O(T + Q), where T denotes the number of 3-holes, or empty triangles, in S and Q that denotes the number of non-convex 4-holes in S. Note that T + Q ranges from Ω(n2) to O(n3), while its expected number is Θ(n2 log n) when the points in S are chosen uniformly and independently at random from a convex and bounded body in the plane.},

While humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first constructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on the former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for the latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel generative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning under the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing correct rules of various attributes from observations.},

This paper further improves Gilmer's technique to derive new bounds in the optimization form for the union-closed sets conjecture. These bounds include Sawin's improvement as a special case. By providing cardinality bounds on auxiliary random variables, we make Sawin's improvement computable, and then evaluate it numerically which yields a bound around \$0.38234\$, slightly better than \$\textbackslash frac\{3-\textbackslash sqrt\{5\}\}\{2\}\$.},

For algebraic tori and semiabelian varieties it was proposed by Boris Zilber and independently by Enrico Bombieri, David Masser, Umberto Zannier in the early 2000's. For semiabelian varieties the conjecture implies the Mordell–Lang and Manin–Mumford conjectures. Richard Pink proposed (again independently) a more general conjecture for Shimura varieties which also implies the André–Oort conjecture. In the case of algebraic tori, Zilber called it the Conjecture on Intersection with Tori (CIT). The general version is now known as the Zilber–Pink conjecture. It states roughly that atypical or unlikely intersections of an algebraic variety with certain special varieties are accounted for by finitely many special varieties.},
