This section defines necessary tools for _convex bodies_ in a plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. We adopt the definition of a convex body as the intersection of half-planes.

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is an intersection of half-planes (see [[02. Geometric Primitives#^def-half-plane]]). ^def-convex-body

# Support Function

Refer to the definition of support functions, tangent lines and half-planes in [[02. Geometric Primitives]]. Along with this we have a definition of the edges of $K$.

> __Theorem [support-function-lipschitz].__ For any convex body $K$, its support function $p_K$ is Lipschitz. Moreover, if $K$ is inside the closed ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin, then $p_K$ is $R$-Lipschitz. ^thm-support-function-lipschitz

_Proof._ (sketch) Support function $p_K$ is the supremum of sine functions generated from each point of $K$. Each sine function has an amplitude of $\leq R$. So the supremum of all such functions is $R$-Lipschitz as well. □

# Vertices

> __Definition [convex-body-edge].__ For any convex body $K$ and angle $t \in S^1$, define the edge $e_K(t)$ as the intersection $l_K(t) \cap K$. ^def-convex-body-edge

> __Definition [boundary].__ For any subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, denote the bondary of $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as $\partial S$. ^def-boundary

> __Theorem [boundary-is-union-all-edges].__ The boundary $\partial K$ of any convex body $K$ is the union ^thm-boundary-is-union-all-edges
$$
\partial K = \bigcup_{t \in S^1} e_K(t)
$$
> of all the edges of $K$.

_Proof._ (sketch) $\partial K \supseteq e_K(t)$ for any $t \in S^1$ is easy. Take any point $p \in \partial K$. If $p$ strictly lie inside the interior of the half-plane $H_K(t)$ for any $t \in S^1$, then $p$ is in the interior of $K$ as well. So $p$ is in $l_K(t)$ for some $t$. □

> __Lemma [convex-body-vertex-lemma].__ For any convex body $K$ and angle $t \in S^1$, the set $e_K(t)$ is a closed line segment because it is a nonempty, bounded, convex and closed subset of $l_K(t)$. So any point $p$ of $e_K(t)$ can be represented as $p = p_K(t)u_t + \alpha v_t$ for some $\alpha$ that spans over some closed interval. ^lem-convex-body-vertex-lemma

> __Definition [convex-body-vertex].__ Under the same assumption as [[#^lem-convex-body-vertex-lemma]], let $v^+_K(t)$ be such a $p$ with the largest value of $\alpha$, and let $v_K^-(t)$ be such a $p$ with the smallest value of $\alpha$. Any of $v_K^+(t)$ or $v_K^-(t)$ are called the _vertices_ of $K$. ^def-convex-body-vertex

> __Corollary [edge-as-vertex-segment].__ By [[#^lem-convex-body-vertex-lemma]] the edge $e_K(t)$ is the closed line segment connecting $v_K^-(t)$ and $v_K^+(t)$. ^cor-edge-as-vertex-segment

Next, we are going to show that $v_K^+(t)$ is right-continuous with respect to $t$ and that $p_K(t)$ is both left and right-differentiable. The following lemma is the hard/technical part for computing limits.

> __Lemma [limits-converging-to-vertex].__ Let $K$ be a convex body and $t$ be an arbitrary angle. We have the following limits all converging to $v_K^+(t)$. ^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex
$$
\lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^+(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } l_K(u) \cap l_K(t) = v_K^+(t)
$$

_Proof._ TODO: fix the name collision $l = l(t', h')$. The proof itself is complete.

![[vertex-right-continuous.jpeg|400]]

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Let $p = v_K^+(t) + \epsilon v_t$. Then by [[#^cor-edge-as-vertex-segment]] the point $p$ is not in $K$. As $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus K$ is open, any sufficiently small open neighborhood of $p$ is disjoint from $K$, so we can take some positive $\epsilon' < \epsilon$ such that the closed line segment connecting $p$ and $q = p - \epsilon' u_t$ is not in $K$ as well. ^assumption-pq-disjoint-from-k

Now consider the line $l$ that passes through both $q$ and $v_K^+(t)$. By the definition of $q = v_K^+(t) - \epsilon' u_t + \epsilon v_t$, we have $l = l(t', h')$ for some $t' \in (t, t + \pi/2)$ and $h' \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $x = v_K^+(t) \cdot v_t$. Let $H' = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus H^\circ(t', h')$. Define a triangular region $T$ as the intersection $T = H_K(t) \cap H' \cap H(t + \pi/2, x + \epsilon)$. 

We will show that $K$ intersected with $H'$ is trapped inside a small triangular region $T$.

> First, $K \cap H'$ is in $H_K(t) \cap H'$ by definition of $H_K(t)$. Next, assume by contradiction that there is $r \in K \cap H$ such that $r$ is also not in $l(t + \pi/2, x + \epsilon)$. Then we have $r \cdot v_t > x + \epsilon$. As both $r$ and $v_K^+(t)$ are in $K \cap H'$, we find a middle point $s$ between $r$ and $v_K^+(t)$ such that $s \cdot v_t = x + \epsilon$ and such that $s \in K \cap H'$. As $s$ is on the line $l(t + \pi/2, x+\epsilon)$ and in $H_K(t) \cap H'$, $s$ is on the line segment connecting $p$ and $q$. But then this contradicts the assumption [[#^assumption-pq-disjoint-from-k]].

So for any angle $u \in (t, t')$, the edge $e_K(u)$ should lie inside the triangular region $T$.

> In the fan $H_K(t) \cap H(t', h')$, the vertex $z = v_K^+(t)$ attains the maximum of $z \cdot u_t$. All other competitors are in $T$, so the maximize $z$ of $z \cdot u_t$ lies in $T$ either way.

Observe that $T$ contains $v_K^+(t)$ and the diameter of $T$ is $< 2\epsilon$. So both endpoints $v_K^+(u)$ and $v_K^-(u)$ are distance $< 2\epsilon$ away from $v_K^+(t)$. This completes the epsilon-delta argument for $\lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^+(u) = \lim_{ u \to t^+ } v_K^-(u) = v_K^+(t)$. Also, note that $l_K(u) \cap l_K(t)$ is inside $T$ as well, so we also show $\lim_{ u \to t^+ } l_K(u) \cap l_K(t) = v_K^+(t)$.  □

An immediate corollary is:

> __Theorem [vertex-right-continuous].__ For any convex body $K$, the vertex $v_K^+(t)$ is a right-continuous function on $t \in S^1$. ^thm-vertex-right-continuous

_Proof._ Exactly the first limit of [[#^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]]. □

We now move on to the left/right differentiability of $p_K(t)$.

> __Definition [left-right-differentiation].__ For any function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on some open subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $t \in X$, define $\partial^+f(t)$ and $\partial^-f(t)$ as the right and left differentiation of $f$ at $t$ if they exists. ^def-left-right-differentiation

We use the following calculation.

> __Lemma [intersection-tangent-lines].__ Let $t, t' \in S^1$ be arbitrary with $t' = t + \theta$ for $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi) \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Then the intersection $l_{K}(t) \cap l_K(t')$ is a point and it is exactly the following.  ^lem-intersection-tangent-lines
$$
l_{K}(t) \cap l_K(t') = p_K(t) u_{t} + \alpha_K(t, \theta) v_{t}
$$
> Here, the value $\alpha_K(t, \theta)$ is defined as the following.
$$
\alpha_K(t, \theta) = \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
$$

_Proof._ Because the point $p = l_{K}(t) \cap l_K(t')$ is on the line $l_K(t)$, we have $p = p_K(t) u_{t} + \alpha v_{t}$
for some constant $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. We use $p \cdot u_{t'} = p_K(t')$ to derive the unique value $\alpha$.
$$
\begin{align*}
p_K(t') &= p_K(t) (u_{t} \cdot u_{t'}) + \alpha (v_{t} \cdot u_{t'}) \\
&= p_K(t) \cos \theta + \alpha \sin \theta
\end{align*}
$$
This gives $\alpha = p_C(t') \csc \theta - p_C(t) \cot \theta$ and completes the proof. □

Using the calculation we show both the following theorems at once.

> __Theorem [support-function-left-right-differentiable].__ For any convex body $K$, $p_K$ is both left and right differentiable. ^thm-support-function-left-right-differentiable

> __Theorem [vertex-formula].__ For any convex body $K$ and angle $t \in S^1$, the following equalities hold.
$$v_K^+(t) = p_K(t)u_t + \partial^+p_K(t)v_t$$
$$v_K^-(t) = p_K(t)u_t + \partial_-p_K(t)v_t.$$
 ^thm-vertex-formula

_Proof._ We show the first equality. (TODO: add proof for the second equality)
The last limit of [[^lem-limits-converging-to-vertex]] and [[#^lem-intersection-tangent-lines]] shows that we have the following.
$$
\begin{align}
v_K^+(t) & = p_K(t)u_t + \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ }  \alpha_K(t, \theta)v_t
\end{align}
$$
Computing the limit,
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ }  \alpha_K(t, \theta) & = \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ } \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \\
& = \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ } \left( \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t)}{\theta} + p_K(t) \frac{1- \cos \theta}{ \theta } \right) \cdot \frac{\theta}{\sin \theta} \\
& = \lim_{ \theta \to 0^+ } \frac{p_K(t + \theta) - p_K(t)}{\theta}  \\
& = \partial^+p_K(t)
\end{align} 
$$
as $(1 - \cos \theta)/\theta \to 0$ and $\theta / \sin \theta \to 1$ as $\theta \to 0$. □

> __Corollary [right-differentiation-right-continuous].__ For any convex body $K$, $\partial^+ p_K$ is right-continuous. ^cor-right-differentiation-right-continuous

_Proof._ By [[#^thm-vertex-right-continuous]] and [[#^thm-vertex-formula]] we have $p_K(t)u_t + \partial^+p_K(t)v_t$ right-continuous. $p_K(t)$ is continuous by [[#^thm-support-function-lipschitz]]. So subtracting and taking the dot product with continuous $v_t$ we get that $\partial^+ p_K$ is right-continuous. □

This is a version of the fundamental theorem of calculus for the support function.

> __Corollary [integral-of-right-differentiation].__ For any convex body $K$ and $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a < b$, we have the following. ^cor-integral-of-right-differentiation
$$
p_K(b) - p_K(a) = \int_{(a, b]} \partial^+p_K(t)\,dt
$$

_Proof._ As $p_K$ is Lipschitz by [[#^thm-support-function-lipschitz]], $p_K$ is also absolutely continuous. This [means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_continuity) that the derivative of $p_k$ exists almost everywhere, and by definition it should be equal to $\partial^+p_K$. By absolute continuity we then get the claimed equation. □

# Support of a Convex Body

Starting Section 03, we understand any sofa $S$ with its _cap_ $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$, a convex body naturally attached to the sofa. And in Section 04, we need a theory on how to understand its area to execute a calculus-of-variation strategy: which is to pertube $K$ a little bit and see how the area of $K$ (or the sofa $S$) changes. This appendix developes necessary vocabularies and theorems to execute that.

For any $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 = t_1 + \theta$ for nonzero $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi)$,
the lines $l_C(t_1)$ and $l_C(t_2)$ are not parallel so they intersect.
Let $v_C(t_1, t_2)$ be the intersection point of two lines.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
For any $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 = t_1 + \theta$ for nonzero $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi)$, we have 
$$
v_C(t_1, t_2) = p_C(t_1) u_{t_1} + \frac{p_C(t_2) - p_C(t_1) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} v_{t_1}.
$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Because the point $v = v_C(t_1, t_2)$ is on the line $l_C(t_1)$,
we have $v = p_C(t_1) u_{t_1} + \alpha v_{t_1}$
for some constant $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
We use $v \cdot u_2 = p_C(t_2)$ to derive $\alpha$.
\begin{align*}
p_C(t_2) &= v \cdot u_2 \\
&= p_C(t_1) (u_{t_1} \cdot u_{t_2}) + \alpha (v_{t_1} \cdot u_{t_2}) \\
&= p_C(t_1) \cos \theta + \alpha \sin \theta
\end{align*}
This gives $\alpha = p_C(t_2) \csc \theta - p_C(t_1) \cot \theta$ and completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
For any point $w \in \mathbb{R}^2$ outside $C$, $w$ is equal to $v_C(t_1, t_2)$	
\end{proposition}

Moreover, 
for any $t \in S^1$ and $0 < \theta < \pi$,
if we define the values
$$l_C^+(t, t+\theta) = \frac{p_C(t_2) - p_C(t_1) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} - \partial_+p_C(t)$$
and
$$l_C^-(t, t-\theta) = -\frac{p_C(t_2) - p_C(t_1) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} + \partial_-p_C(t)$$
then $l_C^+(t, t+\theta)$ is the distance between $v^+_C(t)$ and $v_C(t, t+\theta)$,
and $l_C^-(t, t-\theta)$ is the distance
between $v^-_C(t)$ and $v_C(t, t-\theta)$,
and the values $l_C^+(t, t+\theta)$ and 
$l_C^-(t, t-\theta)$ are monotonically increasing respect to $\theta \in (0, \pi)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We first observe that 
\end{proof}

Most tangent lines touch $C$ at a single vertex.
\begin{proposition}
For any planar convex body $C$, there is only a countable number of angles $t \in S^1$ with the edge $e_C(t)$ being a proper line segment.
So the tangent line $l_C(t)$ touches $C$ at the unique point $v^+_C(t) = v^-_C(t)$ for all but a countable number of values of $t \in S^1$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Use the monotonicity: for any $0 < t < \pi$, $v_C^+(t)$ has strictly lesser $x$-coordinate than $v_C^-(t)$ unless $v_C^+(t) = v_C^-(t)$. Also for any $0 < t < t' < \pi$, $v_C^-(t')$ has lesser or equal $x$-coordinate than $v_C^+(t)$.
Now if $v_C^+(t) \neq v_C^-(t)$ for uncountably many $t$'s, the $x$-coordinate of $v_C^-(\pi / 2)$ descends from the $x$-coordinate of $v_C^+(0)$ `uncountably many times', contradicting that $C$ is bounded. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:func}
For any planar convex body $C$, its support function $p_C$ is both left-differentiable and right-differentiable, and has only a countable number of $t \in S^1$ where the left and right differentiation do not match.

Also, if $C$ lies inside the ball of radius $R \geq 0$ centered at origin, then the functions $p_C, \partial_+p_C, \partial_-p_C$ are all bounded by $R$.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Surface area measure}

We shall construct the \emph{surface area measure} $\beta$ of an arbitrary convex body $C$. 
Informally speaking, for any closed interval $I = [a, b]$ of $S^1$, $\beta(I)$ will be the length of the curve on the boundary of $C$ from $v^-(t_1)$ to $v^+(t_2)$.
In particular, the measure $\beta(\{t\})$ of a singleton $\{t\}$ is the distance between $v^-(t)$ and $v^+(t)$.
Consequently, $\beta([a, b))$ is the distance between $v^-(a)$ and $v^-(b)$ on the boundary, and $\beta((a, b])$ is the distance between $v^+(a)$ and $v^+(b)$ on the boundary.
The construction of such a measure is already known for $n$-dimensional convex bodies \textcolor{red}{TODO: Put citations}. 
However, as we will need show some formulas involving $\beta$ that specifically works for dimension 2, we will construct the surface area measure for dimension 2 in a different way and show later that it matches with the original definition.

Assume for a moment that $p_C$ is twice continuously differentiable.
Then for any angle $t \in S^1$ the tangent line $l_C(t)$ touches $C$ at the unique point $v_C(t) = v_C^+(t) = v_C^-(t) = p_C(t)u_t + p'_C(t)v_t$ on the boundary of $C$.
In particular, $v_C(t)$ parametrizes the boundary points of $C$.
Note that $v'_C(t) = (p_C(t) + p''_C(t))v_t$,
so that the length of the curve that connects $v_C(a)$ and $v_C(b)$ on the boundary of $C$ is 
$$\int_a^b ||v'_C(t)||dt 
= \int_a^b (p_C(t) + p''_C(t)) dt.
= \int_a^b p_C(t) dt + p'_C(b) - p'_C(a)$$
Therefore, in this case, we can say that $p_C(t) + p''_C(t)$ is the density function of the surface are measure $\beta$ we are looking for.

Now let's get back to the general setting where $C$ is an arbitrary convex body and $p_C(t)$ may not differentiable.
From the equation above, we can suspect that this will hold.
$$
\beta((a, b]) = \int_a^b p_C(t) dt + \partial^+_t p_C(b) - \partial^-_t p_C(a)
$$
We will now use this guess to actually define $\beta$.

\begin{definition}
For an arbitrary convex body $C$,
define the function $F_C \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as 
$$
F_C(x) = \int_0^x p_C(t)dt + \partial^+_t p_C(x) - \partial^-_t p_C(0)
$$
so that in particular, 
$$
F_C(b) - F_C(a) = \int_a^b p_C(t)dt + \partial^+_t p_C(b) - \partial^-_t p_C(a)
$$
follows for arbitrary $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For any convex body $C$, $F_C$ is monotonically increasing.
For any $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $0 < b - a < \pi$,
we have $F_C(b) - F_C(a) \geq 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Key ideas: 
First, the value is invariant under
translations of $C$.
That is, adding or subtracting multiples of $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ does not affect the value of $F_C(x)$.

Second, now we can set origin to any point that we want.
So we move $C$ and assume that $v_C(a, b)$ is the origin.
A consequence is that $p_C(t) \leq 0$ for all $t \in [a, b]$.
Another consequence is that $l_C^+(a) = \partial^+_tp_C(b)$, or whatever, that it will give us a positive number as well. This concludes the proof.  
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$F_C$ is right-continuous.	
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1757987/how-to-prove-that-the-right-derivative-of-a-convex-function-is-right-continuous}	
\end{proof}

\todo{Fill this out}
Now $F_C$ gives rise to a measure $\beta_C$ (standard real analysis result -- need to search references).
Goal: NOT to show that $\beta_C$ measures boundary perimeter directly.
We do not use that.
Instead, observe that it works linearly,
and that for the area we do have the formula that is expected.
Trapezodial region, bounded by (i) the segment connecting origin and $v_C^+(a)$, (ii) the segment connecting origin and $v_C^+(b)$, and $l_C(a)$, and $l_C(b)$.
The area of this thing will have a closed form.

\todo{Really, all of this is only to build up the following interface that will be used in calculus of variation part. We only need to show the followings to a general reader.}

With all this, we reach the following.
\begin{theorem}
For any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\beta$, there is a unique \emph{boundary measure} $\beta_K$ on the set $\Gamma_\beta = [0, \beta] \sqcup [\pi / 2, \beta + \pi / 2]$ such that the followings hold.
$$
A^+_K(t) = p_\beta - \int_{s \in (t, \beta]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
A^-_K(t) = p_\beta - \int_{s \in [t, \beta]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
C^+_K(t) = p_\beta + \int_{s \in [\pi / 2, t + \pi / 2]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
C^-_K(t) = p_\beta + \int_{s \in [\pi / 2, t + \pi / 2)} v_s \beta_K(ds)

We only need to show that the given expression is symmetric in $K_1$ and $K_2$
by the characterization of mixed volume.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:convex-curve-delta}
We can in general define a curve parametrized by its tangential angle and arc length as the following.
For any Borel measure $\beta$ on $[a, b]$, define its corresponding curve parametrized $\xx(s)$ by $s$
from 0 to $\beta([a, b])$ as this.
Find some $t \in [a, b]$ so that $\beta([a, t)) \leq s \leq \beta([a, t])$.
When the lower and upper bounds match, ...
The point is that $\Delta$ of the curve is exactly the formula we mention above.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For any convex body $K$, its boundary is a rectifiable curve if we parametrize by arc length $s$.
Moreover, this parametrization $\xx(s)$ is absolutely continuous.
For each point $p$ on the boundary of $K$, we can think of $t$, the angle of tangent line that touches $p$, and $s$ which is the curve length. $s$ and $t$ are increasing `function's of each other, where we allow the function graph to rise 90 degrees upward.
The function $s'(t)$ is exactly the surface area measure $\beta_K$.

For any $\xx : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ absolutely continuous, define its `triangular measure' as

\Delta(\xx) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \xx(t) \times \xx'(t) dt
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For any $\xx_1 : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\xx_2 : [b, c] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ absolutely continuous and
$\xx_1(b) = \xx_2(b)$, the concatenation $\xx_1 * \xx_2 : [a, c] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is well-defined 
and
$$\Delta(\xx_1 * \xx_2) = \Delta(\xx_1) + \Delta(\xx_2)$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:area-jordan}
If $\xx : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is a Jordan curve in counterclockwise direction (that is, $\xx$ is injective and rectifiable and continuous), the area enclosed by $\xx$ is $\Delta(\xx)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
\todo{Find the right literature}
There are a lot of generalizations of Green's theorem out there.
e.g. ``A NOTE ON GREEN'S THEOREM by B. D. CRAVEN'' or Potts.
Apostol's Mathematical Analysis: A Modern Approach To Advanced Calculus seems to contain
the proof most extensively.
The theorem above has to be the specialization of some Green's theorem.
\end{remark}

Plans on using this: For the most general bound $\cA_1$, there are a total of 4 curves and two line segments for the area.
Use the curve injectivity + counterclockwise direction and Theorem \ref{thm:area-jordan}
to chop down into integrals of different intervals.
For convex curves, use Theorem \ref{thm:convex-curve-delta}.
For inner niche part, just use the absolutely continuous formula with the following computation.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:variation-curve}
Let $\xx = (1 - \lambda) \xx_1 + \lambda \xx_2$ be a line segment parametrization from
$\xx_1$ to $\xx_2$ where $\xx_1, \xx_2 : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ are absolutely continuous functions.
Then we do the following computation. % \left. \frac{d}{d\lambda} \right|_{\lambda = 0}
\begin{align*}
\Delta(\xx) & = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \xx(t) \times \xx'(t) 
= \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b (\xx_1 + \lambda (\xx_2 - \xx_1)) \times (\xx'_1 + \lambda (\xx'_2 - \xx'_1)) \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \lambda \left( \int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'_1 + \xx_1 \times (\xx'_2 - \xx'_1) dt \right) + \textrm{(const/quad terms of lambda)} \\
\end{align*}

Do integration by parts.
\begin{align*}
\int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'_1 dt & = 
(\xx_2(b) - \xx_1(b)) \times \xx_1 (b) - (\xx_2(a) - \xx_1(a)) \times \xx_1(a)
- \int_a^b (\xx'_2 - \xx'_1) \times \xx_1 dt \\
& = \xx_2(b) \times \xx_1 (b) - \xx_2(a) \times \xx_1(a)
+ \int_a^b \xx_1 \times (\xx'_2 - \xx'_1) dt
\end{align*}

So we have
\begin{align*}
\left. \frac{d}{d\lambda} \right|_{\lambda = 0} \Delta(\xx) & = 
\frac{1}{2} \left( \int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'_1 + \xx_1 \times (\xx'_2 - \xx'_1) dt \right) \\
& = \frac{\xx_2(a) \times \xx_1 (a) - \xx_2(b) \times \xx_1(b)}{2}
+ \int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'_1 dt
\end{align*}

\end{theorem}%%
