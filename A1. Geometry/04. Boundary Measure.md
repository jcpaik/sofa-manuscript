# Construction



> __Definition [boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, there exists a unique measure $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ that satisfies the followings. ^def-boundary-measure
$$
v_K^+(t_2) - v_K^+(t_1) = \int_{s \in (t_1, t_2]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
v_K^+(t) - v_K^-(t) = v_t \beta_K\left( \left\{ t \right\} \right)
$$

_Proof._ (TODO: add the construction) â–¡

TODO: we need to clarify what does it mean by an interval $[a, b]$ in $S^1$. The numbers $a$ and $b$ are representatives in $\mathbb{R}$ such that they satisfy $0 \leq b - a \leq 2\pi$.

> __Theorem [boundary-measure-support].__ The support of any convex body $K$ ([[03. Convex Bodies#^def-convex-body-support]]) is the support of the measure $\beta_K$. ^thm-boundary-measure-support


The boundary of $K$ is described by $t$ (tangential angle) and $s$ (arc-length). The problem here is that the relationship between $t$ and $s$ are not necessarily bijective. Instead, we have the following.

> __Definition [reparametrizations].__ Let $\beta$ be a measure on some interval $[a, b]$ with $B = \beta([a, b])$. Define the following functions $F_\beta : [a, b] \to [0, B]$ and $G_\beta : [0, B] \to [a, b]$. ^def-reparametrizations
$$
\begin{gather}
F_{\beta} (t) = \beta([a, t]) \\
G_{\beta} (s) = \inf \left\{ t \in [a, b] : F_\beta(t) \geq s \right\} 
\end{gather}
$$

The generalized inverse $G_\beta$ maps $s$ to $t$.

Take any point p on the boundary. Then take any angle $t$. Measure the gap etc etc to locate $s$. Define the map from p to that gap thing.
