We mainly work with Borel measures on $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^2,$ and $S^1$.

> __Definition [lebesgue-stieltjes-measure].__ For any right-continuous, bounded-variation function $F : I \to \mathbb{R}$ on any interval $I$ (open, closed, half-open, finite, infinite, etc.) we have a unique signed Borel measure $dF$ called the _Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure_ on $I$ such that $dF\left( (a, b] \right) = F(b) - F(a)$ for any interval $(a, b]$ in $I$. ^def-lebesgue-stieltjes-measure
