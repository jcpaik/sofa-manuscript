This section defines necessary tools for _convex bodies_ in a plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

Starting Section 03, we understand any sofa $S$ with its _cap_ $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$, a convex body naturally attached to the sofa. And in Section 04, we need a theory on how to understand its area to execute a calculus-of-variation strategy: which is to pertube $K$ a little bit and see how the area of $K$ (or the sofa $S$) changes. This appendix developes necessary vocabularies and theorems to execute that.

> __Definition [shape].__ A _shape_ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. ^def-shape

We adopt the definition of a convex body as the intersection of half-planes.

> __Definition [convex-body].__ A _convex body_ $K$ is a shape which is an intersection of half-planes [[02. Geometric Primitives#^def-half-plane]]. ^def-convex-body
