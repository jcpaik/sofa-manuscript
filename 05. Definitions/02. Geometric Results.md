We will use the following results on a convex body of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as tools to approach the sofa problem. The proof of these results are irrelevant to the main discussion on sofas, so we delegate their proofs in an appendix.

# Convex Bodies

> __Theorem [boundary-parametrization].__ For any convex body $K$ with nonempty interior, the topological boundary $\partial K$ is both (i) a Jordan curve and (ii) the union $\cup_{t \in S^1} e_K(t)$ of all the edges of $K$. Write $B_K$ for the length of $\partial K$. For any point $p \in \partial K$ there is a unique positively oriented arc-length parametrization $\mathbf{x}_{K, p} : [0, B_K]$ of $\partial K$ that starts and ends with $p$.
> 
> For any $p, q \in \partial K$, let $B_{K, p, q}$ be the length between $p$ and $q$ measured on the curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, p}$ (if $q=p$ then choose $B_{K, p, q} = B_K$). Let $\mathbf{x}_{K, p, q}$ be the initial part $\mathbf{x}_{K, p}|_{[0, B_{K, p, q}]}$ that connects $p$ and $q$ counterclockwise in $\partial K$. Then for any $t_1, t_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ with $t_2 \in (t_1, t_1 + 2\pi]$, the function $\mathbf{x}_{K, v^+_K(t_1), v^+_K(t_2)}$ parametrizes the set $\cup_{t \in (t_1, t_2]} e_K(t)$. If $t_2 \in (t_1, t_1 + 2\pi)$, then the function $\mathbf{x}_{K, v^-_K(t_1), v^+_K(t_2)}$ parametrizes the set $\cup_{t \in [t_1, t_2]} e_K(t)$. ^thm-boundary-parametrization

> __Theorem [boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, there is a uniquely associated _boundary measure_ $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ such that it satisfies the _vertex formulas_: For any $a < b$, ^thm-boundary-measure
$$
\int_{(a, b]} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^+(a) 
$$
$$
\int_{[a, b]} v_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^-(a) 
$$

> __Theorem [boundary-measure-area].__ For any convex body $K$, the boundary measure satisfies the _area formula_: ^thm-boundary-measure-area
$$
\left| K \right| = \frac{1}{2} \int_{S^1}p_K(t)\,\beta_K(dt)
$$
> Moreover, we have the following formulas for the area functional on boundary segments.
$$
I\left( \mathbf{x}_{K, v_K^+(t_0), v_K^+(t_1)} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{(t_0, t_1]}p_K(t)\,\beta_K(dt)
$$
$$
I\left( \mathbf{x}_{K, v_K^-(t_0), v_K^+(t_1)} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{[t_0, t_1]}p_K(t)\,\beta_K(dt)
$$

> __Theorem [boundary-measure-area-variation].__ For any convex bodies $K_1, K_2$, let $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$ be the linear interpolation between them. Then we have the following. ^thm-boundary-measure-area-variation
$$
\left. \frac{d}{d\lambda} \right|_{\lambda=0} |K| = \int_{S^1} (p_{K_2}(t) - p_{K_1}(t)) \, \beta_{K_1}(dt)
$$

> __Theorem [boundary-measure-support].__ If $K$ is supported by some $\Theta \subseteq S^1$, then the support of the measure $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ is also contained in $\Theta$. That is, the measure of $\beta_K$ is zero outside $\Theta$. ^thm-boundary-measure-support

> __Definition [convex-body-linear].__ Let $V$ be a vector space and $f$ be a map from the collection of all convex bodies to $V$. If for any convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ and $a, b \geq 0$ we have $f(aK_1+bK_2) = af(K_1) + b f(K_2)$, then say that $f$ is _linear_ on the convex bodies. If $V=\mathbb{R}$ call such $f$ a _linear functional_ on convex bodies. ^def-convex-body-linear

> __Theorem [convex-body-linear].__ Support function $p_K$, boundary measure $\beta_K$, vertices $v_K^+$ and $v_K^-$ are all linear with respect to convex body $K$. Also, for fixed and different $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$, the intersection point $l_K(t_1) \cap l_K(t_2)$ is linear respect to $K$. ^thm-convex-body-linear

> __Theorem [gauss-minkowski].__ (Gauss-Minkowski) Let $p_0$ be an arbitrary point on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $t_0 \in S^1$ be an arbitrary angle. Then any convex body $K$ with the vertex $v_K^+(t_0) = p_0$ corresponds bijectively to an arbitrary (nonnegative) measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ such that $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$ by $\beta = \beta_K$. ^thm-gauss-minkowski

> __Theorem [supported-gauss-measure].__ The correspondence in [[#^thm-gauss-minkowski]] maps the convex bodies $K$ supported by closed $\Theta \subseteq S^1$ bijectively to arbitrary (nonnegative) measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ with support $\Theta$ such that $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$. ^thm-supported-gauss-measure

# Jordan Curve

> __Theorem [jordan-curve].__ Any Jordan curve $J$ divides the complement $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus J$ into two connected components: an unbounded region $\mathcal{U}(J)$, and a bounded region $\mathcal{B}(J)$. Their boundaries are both $J$. ^thm-jordan-curve

%%
> __Definition [winding-number].__ Let $\Gamma$ be a closed curve parametrized by $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$. Let $p$ be a point not in $\Gamma$. Define the _winding number_ $W(\mathbf{x}, p)$ as the  ^def-winding-number

TODO: Add a definition of what is a _positively oriented Jordan curve_.
%%

> __Theorem [green].__ If $J$ is a Jordan curve with a positively oriented, rectifiable parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$, then the area of the bounded region $\mathcal{B}(J)$ can be computed as the following. ^thm-green
$$
\left| \mathcal{B}(J) \right| = I(\mathbf{x})
$$

# Mamikon's Theorem

> __Theorem [mamikon].__ (Mamikon) Let $K$ be an arbitrary convex body. Let $p, q \in \partial K$ be two different points on the boundary of $K$. Let $t_p, t_q \in \mathbb{R}$ be the angles such that $p \in e_K(t_p)$ and $q \in e_K(t_q)$ and $t_p < t_q < t_p + 2 \pi$. Let $\mathbf{y} : [t_p, t_q] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be some parametrization of a rectifiable curve with a function $f : [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathbf{y}(t) = v_K^+(t) + f(t)v_t$ for all $t \in [t_p, t_q]$. Then the following holds. ^thm-mamikon
$$
I(\mathbf{y}) + I\left( \mathbf{y}(t_q), q \right) - I(\mathbf{x}_{K, p, q}) - I\left( \mathbf{y}(t_p), p \right) =  \frac{1}{2}\int_{t_p}^{t_q} f(t) ^2 \, dt
$$

This is a variant of Mamikon's theorem where $\mathbf{y}(t) = l_K(t) \cap l_K(t_q)$ parametrizes a segment of the tangent line $l_K(t_q)$. It is almost an immediate consequence of [[#^thm-mamikon]] but is slightly different in the details.

> __Theorem [mamikon-tangent-line].__ Let $K$ be an arbitrary convex body. Let $p, q \in \partial K$ be two different points on the boundary of $K$. Let $t_p, t_q \in \mathbb{R}$ be the angles such that $p \in e_K(t_p)$ and $q \in e_K(t_q)$ and $t_p < t_q < t_p + \pi$. For every $t \in [t_p, t_q)$, define $f(t)$ to be the value such that $l_K(t) \cap l_K(t_q) = v_K^+(t) + f(t) v_t$. Let $r = l_K(t_p) \cap l_K(t_q)$. Then $f$ is integrable and the following holds. ^thm-mamikon-tangent-line
$$
I(r, q) - I(\mathbf{x}_{K, p, q}) - I\left(r, p \right) =  \frac{1}{2}\int_{t_p}^{t_q} f(t) ^2 \, dt
$$
