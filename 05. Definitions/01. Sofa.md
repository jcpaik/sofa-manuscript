We rigorously define what is a sofa and state the moving sofa problem formally. We first set up the hallway.

> __Definition [shape].__ A _shape_ is a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Denote the area (Borel measure) of a shape $X$ as $|X|$. ^def-shape

> __Definition [strip].__ Let $H = \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1]$ and $V = [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}$ be the horizontal and vertical strips respectively. ^def-strip

> __Definition [hallway].__ The standard _hallway_ $L$ of unit width that rotates 90 degrees is the union $L = L_H \cup L_V$ of its _horizontal side_ $L_H = L \cap H = (-\infty, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and _vertical side_ $L_V = L \cap V = [0, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ respectively. Let $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)$ be the inner and outer corner of $L$ respectively. Let $a$ and $b$ be the lines $x=1$ and $y=1$ passing through the outer corner $\mathbf{y}$ representing the outer walls of $L$. Let $c$ and $d$ be the half-lines $(-\infty, 0] \times \left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0 \right\} \times (-\infty, 0]$ emanating from the inner corner $\mathbf{x}$ representing the inner walls of $L$. ^def-hallway

To define a sofa, we need to define its rigid motion. A rigid motion is described by a continuous path of rigid transformations.

> __Definition [rigid-motion].__ For any $\theta \in S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, define the map $R_\theta : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the rotation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ around the origin by a counterclockwise angle of $\theta$. For any $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$, define the map $T_\mathbf{v} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as the translation of $\mathbb{R}^2$ by the vector $\mathbf{v}$.
> 
> A _proper rigid transformation_ is the composition $f = T_v \circ R_\theta$ for any choice of $\theta \in S^1$ and $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$. The _set of all proper rigid transformation_ $\mathcal{T}_r$ can be identified with $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ by the bijective map $(\theta, \mathbf{v}) \mapsto T_\mathbf{v} \circ R_\theta$ and inherits the topology of $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2$. The value $\theta \in S^1$ is the _rotation angle_ of the proper rigid transformation $f$. We also say simply that $f$ _rotates the plane_ by an angle of $\theta$.
> 
> A _rigid motion_ is a continuous path $f_* : [a, b] \to \mathcal{T}_r$ in the set of all proper rigid transformations $\mathcal{T}_r$. We put the time $t \in [a, b]$ as a subscript of $f$ to denote the transformation $f_t$ at time $t$. ^def-rigid-motion

Now we are ready to define what is a sofa.

> __Definition [sofa].__ A shape $S$ is a _sofa_ if it is connected and there exists a rigid motion $f_- : [a, b] \to \mathcal{T}$ such that the followings hold. ^def-sofa
> 
> - $f_a(S) \subseteq L_H$. That is, the sofa starts in the horizontal side $L_V$ of the hallway.
> - $f_t(S) \subseteq L$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. That is, the sofa stays inside the hallway $L$ at all the time.
> - $f_b(S) \subseteq L_V$. That is, the sofa ends in the vertical side $L_H$ of the hallway.
>   
> Call such a rigid motion a _movement_ of the sofa $S$. Call a sofa a _maximum sofa_ if it attains the maximum area of a sofa.

> __Figure [sofa-in-movement].__ A sofa $S$ in movement. The initial position $f_a(S)$ colored red is in the horizontal side $L_H$, and the final position $f_b(S)$ colored blue is in the vertical side $L_V$. The sofa in movement $f_t(S)$ colored purple with traces in grey lines is in the hallway $L$. ^fig-sofa-in-movement

> ![40%](images/sofa-in-movement.svg)

> __Remark [sofa-def].__ One may question why we restrict a sofa to a shape. That is, a bounded and closed set. The rationale behind it is this: ^rem-sofa-def
> 
> - If an arbitrary set $S$ which might not be closed admits the same movement $f$ inside the hallway $L$, then its closure $\overline{S}$ also admits the same movement $f$ as the hallway parts $L, L_H, L_V$ are closed. So it does not hurt generality to assume that $S$ is closed.
> - There is no unbounded sofa abiding to the conditions of [[#^def-sofa]].

> __Remark [sofa-connected].__ We depend on the connectedness of the sofa throughly in this paper. That is, although there is a possibility of an 'disconnected sofa' abiding to the other conditions of [[#^def-sofa]] and having a larger area, we exclude them in our discussion. ^rem-sofa-connected

Given a movement $f$ of a sofa $S$, we can define a _rotation angle_ of $S$.

> __Definition [rotation-angle].__ For any rigid motion $f : [a, b] \to \mathcal{T}$, its _rotation angle_ $\omega$ is defined as the following. First, note that the rotation angle $\theta(t) \in S^1$ of the map $f(t)$ is continuous with respect to $t \in [a, b]$. Let the map $\hat{\theta} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be any lift of the continous map $\theta : [a, b] \to S^1$ with respect to the covering $\mathbb{R} \to S^1 \simeq \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$. Then the difference $\hat{\theta}(b) - \hat{\theta}(a)$ is independent of the choice of $\hat{\theta}$. Define $\omega$ as $\omega = \hat{\theta}(a) - \hat{\theta}(b)$ (note that the sign is reversed, so that _clockwise_ rotation of sofa is counted as positive).
> 
> For any sofa $S$, say that $\omega$ is a _rotation angle_ of $S$ if there is a movement $f$ of $S$ with the rotation angle $\omega$. ^def-rotation-angle

We will only consider sofas of rotation angle $\omega \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$. Indeed, Gerver has shown that a sofa of maximum area have rotation angle in (some interval) and this has been reduced down by Romik-Kallus to (some other interval). Here we provide a self-contained proof that we can assume $\omega \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$.

> __Theorem [rotation-angle-range].__ Any sofa $S$ of maximum area admits a movement with rotation angle $\omega \in [\pi/4, \pi/2]$. ^thm-rotation-angle-range

_Proof._ Consider any sofa $S$ of rotation angle $\omega$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the movement $f_t$ of $S$ admits the time interval $t \in [0, T]$ for some $T \geq 0$ and that the sofa $S$ is located at the initial position $S = S_0 = f_0(S)$ of the movement. So $S$ is contained in the horizontal strip $V$ in particular. 

Observe that $S_T = f_T(S)$ is a copy of $S$ rotated clockwise by an angle of $\omega$ and is contained in the vertical strip $V$. Thus, $S$ is contained in a copy $V'$ of $V$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$. So if $-\pi/4 \leq \omega \leq \pi/4$, $S$ cannot be a maximum sofa because $S$ is inside the parallelogram $H \cap V'$ of area $\leq \sqrt{2}$.

Observe that for any time $t \in [0, T]$, the sofa $S_t = f_t(S)$ is contained in $L$ so the rotated hallway $L_t = f_t^{-1}(L)$ contains $S$. Also, $L_0 = L$ and $L_T$ is the hallway $L$ rotated _counterclockwise_ by $\omega$. If $\omega \leq - \pi/4$, then by the intermediate value theorem on the angle of rotation of $L_t$ with respect to $t \in [0, T]$, there is a hallway $L_t$ rotated counterclockwise by $-\pi/4$ that contains $S$. Now the intersection $H \cap L_t$ has area $\sqrt{2}$ and contains $S$, so $S$ cannot be a maximum sofa.

Thus, any maximum sofa has a rotation angle $\omega \geq \pi/4$. We will show that if $\omega > \pi/2$, then $S$ also admits a movement of rotation angle exactly $\pi/2$. By the intermediate value theorem on the angle of rotation of $S_t$, there is some $t \in [0, T]$ so that $S_t = f_t(S)$ is rotated clockwise by an angle of $\pi/2$. As $S \subseteq H$, we also have $S_t \subseteq f_t(H)$ as well, and so the rotated sofa $S_t$ is contained in both $L$ and a vertical strip $f_t(H)$ of width 1. Thus the sofa $S_t$ can be translated horizontally in the right direction inside $L$ and can be placed inside $L \cap V$. Now the new movement of $S$ that replaces the original movement starting from time $t$ with the horizontal translation is a movement with rotation angle $\pi/2$. â–¡
