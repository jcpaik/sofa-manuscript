We will use the following results on a convex body of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as basic tools to approach the sofa problem. The proof of these results are irrelevant to the main discussion on sofas, so we delegate their proofs in an appendix.

> __Theorem [boundary-parametrization].__ For any convex body $K$ with nonempty interior, the topological boundary $\partial K$ is both (i) a Jordan arc and (ii) the union $\cup_{t \in S^1} e_K(t)$ of all the edges of $K$. Also, for any point $p \in \partial K$ there is a unique positively oriented Jordan curve $\mathbf{x}_{K, p} : [0, B_K]$ that starts with $p$ parametrizing $\partial K$. For any $p, q \in \partial K$ let $\mathbf{x}_{K, p, q}$ be the initial part of $\mathbf{x}_{K, p}$ that connects $p$ and $q$ counterclockwise in $\partial K$. ^thm-boundary-parametrization

> __Theorem [boundary-measure].__ For any convex body $K$, there is a uniquely associated measure $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ such that it satisfies the following property. ^thm-boundary-measure-
> 
> - It satisfies the _vertex formulas_: For any $a < b$, 
$$
\int_{(a, b]} u_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^+(b) - v_K^+(a) 
$$
$$
\int_{[a, b]} u_t \, \beta(dt) = v_K^-(b) - v_K^+(a) 
$$
> - For such $\beta_K$, it satisfies the _area formula_: The area of $K$ is the following.
$$
\left| K \right| = \frac{1}{2} \int_{S^1}p_K(t)\,\beta(dt)
$$
> - Moreover, we have the following formulas for the area functional on boundary segments.
$$
I\left( \mathbf{x}_{K, v_K^+(t_0), v_K^+(t_1)} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{(t_0, t_1]}p_K(t)\,\beta(dt)
$$
$$
I\left( \mathbf{x}_{K, v_K^-(t_0), v_K^+(t_1)} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{[t_0, t_1]}p_K(t)\,\beta(dt)
$$
> - If $K$ is supported by some $\Theta \subseteq S^1$, then the support of the measure $\beta_K$ on $S^1$ is also contained in $\Theta$. That is, the measure of $\beta_K$ is zero outside $\Theta$.

> __Theorem [mamikon].__ Let $K$ be an arbitrary convex body. Let $p, q \in \partial K$ be two different points on the boundary of $K$. Let $t_p, t_q \in \mathbb{R}$ be the angles such that $p \in e_K(t_p)$ and $q \in e_K(t_q)$ and $t_p < t_q \leq t_p + 2 \pi$. Let $\mathbf{y} : [t_p, t_q] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be some parametrization of a rectifiable curve with a function $f : [t_0, t_1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathbf{y}(t) = v_K^+(t) + f(t)v_t$ for all $t \in [t_p, t_q]$. Then the following holds. ^thm-mamikon
$$
I(\mathbf{y}) + I\left( \mathbf{y}(t_q), q \right) - I(\mathbf{x}_{K, p, q}) - I\left( \mathbf{y}(t_0), p \right) =  \frac{1}{2}\int_{a}^{b} f(t) ^2 \, dt
$$
