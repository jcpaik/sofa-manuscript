We develop a formalization of Mamikon's Theorem.

> __Theorem [mamikon].__ Let $\mathbf{x}(s)$ be a convex curve with a boundary measure $\beta$ on $[a, b]$ and the arc-length parametrization $\mathbf{x} : [0, B] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ for $B = \beta([a, b])$. Let $\mathbf{y} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a curve such that $\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{x}(F_\beta(t)) + f(t) u_t$ for some almost everywhere defined $f$ on $[a, b]$. Then we have the following. ^thm-mamikon
$$
I(\mathbf{y}) - I(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \mathbf{y}(b) \times \mathbf{x}(B) - \mathbf{y}(a) \times \mathbf{x}(0) \right) + \frac{1}{2}\int_{a}^{b} f(t) ^2 \, dt
$$
$$
\begin{align}
I(y) & = \frac{1}{2}\left( \int_a^b \, \right) 
\end{align}
$$

Let $K$ be any convex body. Let $\mathbf{y} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ 

Q. convex curve -> NOT continuous. Assume a square - what would be the Mamikon for that one?

- Boundary of a convex body
	- admits a continuous parametrization
	- do we want to develop that as well?
- Mamikon's principle for convex bodies
	- using signed sum, the result will be described rather easil
