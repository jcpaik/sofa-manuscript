> __Theorem [jordan-curve].__ Any Jordan Curve $J$ divides the complement $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus J$ into two connected components: an unbounded region $\mathcal{U}(J)$, and a bounded region $\mathcal{B}(J)$. Their boundaries are both $J$. ^thm-jordan-curve

# Applying to A_2 upper bound

Observations:
- The upper bondary of the cap is on 'top' of the Jordan curve (no other points sharing the same $x$-coordinate has higher value of $y$-coordinate) and it monotonically moves to the right.
- For any point $p$ of $J$ which is not on the upper boundary, the ray $R_D(p)$ is disjoint from the set $S$. 

So one strategy is: For any point $p$ of $S$,
