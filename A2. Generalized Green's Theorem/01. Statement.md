In order to compute the area of the niche of a monotone sofa, we need to invoke a generalized version of Green's theorem to arbitrary rectifiable Jordan curve. We mainly follow the following reference for the definitions and terminologies that we will use.

We first clarify what is a rectifiable Jordan curve by citing the main reference.

> __Theorem [rectifiable-iff-bounded-variation].__ (Theorem 8-25) A curve described by a (not necesarily continuous) function $\mathbf{x}(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ defined on $t \in [a, b]$ is _rectifiable_ if and only if each $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are of bounded variation. ^thm-rectifiable-iff-bounded-variation

> __Definition [jordan-curve].__ (Definition 8-16) Let $\mathbf{x} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a continuous function. If $\mathbf{x}$ is one-to-one on $[a, b)$ and $\mathbf{x}(a) = \mathbf{x}(b)$, then the image $\Gamma$ of $\mathbf{x}$ is called a _Jordan curve_. We say that $\Gamma$ is _described by_ . ^def-jordan-curve
