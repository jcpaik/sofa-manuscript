- [ ] Make the section on monotone sofas more brief and to the point.
- [ ] Add proper figures of convex bodies.
- [ ] Add an exaggerated, better looking version of Gerver's sofa
	- For demonstrating how it looks like
	- For demonstrating the fact that the contact type more or less stay the same for its neighborhood
	- [ ] Use path-to-sofa code that I made. Romik's rendering of Gerver's sofa has 300 vertices in total.
- [ ] Add support for building a sofa from its support function.

### Scrapebook

The contact type structure essentially do not change in a neighborhood of Gerver's sofa when the Hausdorff measure is taken. Observe that the condition of structure theorem is immediately satisfied by a sufficient nbhd of Gerver's sofa. And what Romik-Kallus has essentially shown is that IF there is a single unique maximum, we can identify the epsilon nbhd of the maximum as close as possible under the Hausdorff measure.

- Injectivity, strict interior : Use `SofaDesinger`
- Prove strict interior upper bound $\mathcal{A}_{1, a, b}$ using a similar technique.
- Use $\mathcal{A}_{1, a, b}$ to prove full injectivity?
	- Two possible paths:
		- Prove an density upper bound of boundary measure, or
		- Use balancedness on lower sides
	- Which is more effective? 
		- It depends on experimentation results
		- Need better toolings of `SofaDesigner`

- How to deal with balancedness?
	- Current path:
		- Use balancedness of polygonal sofas
		- Prove a limiting theorem
		- Show using SofaDesigner that horizontal edges are of length >= C
		- Use that and SofaDesigner again to show that niche contains the down-left corner of $P_\omega$.
	- New path:
		- Use that any sofa of angle $\omega$ can be made into a sofa of angle 90 degrees by cutting some region of the sofa.
