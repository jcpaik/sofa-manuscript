$C$ a convex subset of an affine space $\mathcal{A}$

Functionals $f : C \to \mathbb{R}$ on $C$. 

$f$ is _affine_ if $f((1-\lambda)x + \lambda y) = (1 - \lambda) f(x) + \lambda f(y)$
$f$ is _quadratic_ if $f((1-\lambda)x + \lambda y)$ is um... some quadratic polynomial on $\lambda$ for all $x$ and $y$??
- f(x, x) where f(x, y) is some 2-affine map
$f$ is _positive definite_ if this quadratic polynomial always have a nonnegative coefficient of $\lambda^2$?

How to write something?
- Of course back and forth.
- If I really need to do A, and for that I need B, and for that I need C ....
	- do I have to write starting with Z?
	- Or, how about I start writing A first?
