Instead of moving a sofa $S$ inside the fixed hallway $L$, we can fix the sofa $S$ and move/rotate the hallway $L$ by looking at the movement in perspective of the sofa. That is, the sofa is an intersection of rotating hallways. This observation has been used as the first step in many existing works.

TODO: insert figure here and add references.

We will soon consider only a finite intersection of hallways with a prescribed set of angles. With this, we introduce the following notion of an intersection of rotating hallways.

> __Definition [hallway-intersection].__ A connected shape $S$ is a _hallway intersection_ with _rotation angle_ $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ and _angle set_ $\Theta \subseteq \left[ 0, \omega \right]$ if the followings hold.
> - $\Theta$ is a closed set such that $\left\{ 0, \omega \right\} \subseteq \Theta$
> - $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$
> - For every $\theta \in \Theta$, $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_\theta(L)$, the hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\theta$.
> - $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_\omega(V)$, the vertical strip rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$.

We will show that a sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ is, up to rigid transformation, exactly a hallway intersection with the following angle set.

> __Definition [full-angle-set].__ For any $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, define $$\Pi_\omega = [0, \omega] \cup [\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega] \cup \{\pi + \omega, 3 \pi/2\}$$ ^def-full-angle-set

# Tangent Hallway

> __Definition [tangent-rigid-motion].__ For any shape $S$ and an angle $t \in S^1$, define $f_S(t)$ as the  rigid motion $f_S (t) = R_t \circ T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}$.  ^def-tangent-rigid-motion

_Proof._ The continuity of $f_S(t)$ comes from the continuity of the support function $p_S(t)$. □

> __Definition [tangent-hallway].__ For any shape $S$ and an angle $t \in S^1$, define the _tangent hallway_ $L_S(t) = [f_S(t)](L)$ of $S$ with angle $t$. Note that $f_S(t)$ is a proper rigid transformation so it is a map from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
> Accordingly, define the _inner corner_ $\mathbf{x}_S(t) = [f_S(t)](0, 0)$ and _outer corner_ $\mathbf{y}_S(t) = [f_S(t)](1, 1)$ of the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$. ^def-tangent-hallway

> __Lemma [in-tangent-hallway].__ If a shape $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$ for an angle $t$, then the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ contains $S$ as well. ^lem-in-tangent-hallway

_Proof._ As $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$, the set $S' = [f_S(t)]^{-1}(S)$ is contained in a translation of $[f_S(t)]^{-1}(R_t(L)) = T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(L)$ and thus a translation of $L$. We will show that $S'$ is contained in $L$. This proves the goal as $S' \subseteq L$ implies the following. 
$$S = [f_{S}(t)](S') \subseteq [f_S(t)](L)=L_S(t)$$
To show $S' \subseteq L$, we first compute $p_{S'}(0) = 1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2)=1$. For any $u \in S^1$ we have the computation
$$p_{S}(u) = p_{[f_S(t)](S')}(u) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(u-t)$$
so by letting $u=t$, we have $p_S(t) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(0)=p_{S'}(0)+p_S(t)-1$ and by letting $u=t+\pi/2$, we have $p_S(t + \pi/2) = p_{T_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(\pi/2)=p_{S'}(\pi/2)+p_S(t + \pi/2)-1$. That is, by evaluation we have $p_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$.
Now we show $S' \subseteq L$. By assumption we have $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$ for some vector $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. By comparing their support functions at $t=0, \pi/2$ we have $1=p_{S'}(0) \leq p_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(0) = 1 + x_{0}$ and $1=p_{S'}(\pi/2) \leq p_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(\pi/2) = 1 + y_0$ so we have $0 \leq x_0, y_0$. The set $(-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$ is disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. Using $0 \leq x_0, y_0$ on the disjointness, we have that $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0) \subseteq (-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$$ is also disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. So the set $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$ is disjoint from $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$. Also, $S' \subseteq (-\infty, 1] \times (-\infty, 1]$ because $p_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$. Thus, $S' \subseteq L = (-\infty, 1] \times (-\infty, 1] \setminus (-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$. □

> __Theorem [sofa-iff-hallway-intersection].__ A shape $S$ is a sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$ if and only if $S$ is connected and there is a proper rigid transformation $g$ such that $g(S)$ is a hallway intersection with the angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$. ^thm-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection

_Proof._ ($\implies$) First we assume that $S$ is a sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in [0, \pi/2]$, and prove that there is a proper rigid transformation $g$ such that $g(S)$ is a hallway intersection with angle set $\Theta = [0, \omega]$. Let $f_-$ be the movement of the sofa (see [[01. Sofa#^def-sofa]]).
