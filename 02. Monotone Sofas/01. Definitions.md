Instead of moving a sofa $S$ inside the fixed hallway $L$, we can fix the sofa $S$ and move/rotate the hallway $L$ by looking at the movement in perspective of the sofa. That is, the sofa is an intersection of rotating hallways.

TODO: insert figure here.

> __Theorem [moving-hallway-angle].__ Let $S$ be a sofa with rotation angle $\beta$. Then there is a  ^thm-moving-hallway-angle

We will soon consider only a finite intersection of hallways with a prescribed set of angles. With this, we introduce the following notion.

> __Definition [hallway-intersection].__ A connected shape $S$ is a _hallway intersection_ with angle set $\Theta$ and rotation angle $\omega$ if the followings hold.
