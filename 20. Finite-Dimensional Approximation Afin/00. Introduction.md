The main challenge in analyzing a monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$ with a cap $K$ comes from analyzing its niche $\mathcal{N}(K)$. Unlike the convex set $K$, the set $\mathcal{N}(K)$ is a _union_ of different polygons. Which part of the inner corner will contribute to the boundary of $\mathcal{N}(K)$ changes drastically.
Challenging and important TODO: elaborate more on this. Essentially, this is the part that Gerver couldn't solve.

We propose the _injectivity hypothesis_ to resolve this issue. The hypothesis states that there is a monotone sofa $S$ that attains the maximum area, such that the inner corner $\mathbf{x}_S(t)$ is injective and always lies inside the parallelogram $P_\omega$.

> __Theorem [injectivity].__ Assume any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\omega \in [\omega_0, \pi/2]$. If the monotone sofa $\mathcal{M}(K)$ has an area $\geq 22195/10000$, then the followings are true. ^thm-injectivity
> 
> 1. For any $t \in (0, \omega)$, $\mathbf{x}_K(t)$ is in the interior $F_\omega^\circ$ of the fan always.
> 2. If $\omega = \pi/2$, then $\mathbf{x}_K(0)$ is on the right side of $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2)$. That is, $\mathbf{x}_K(\pi/2) \cdot u_0 < \mathbf{x}_K(0) \cdot u_0$.
> 3. The curve $\mathbf{x}_K : [0, \omega] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is injective. 

Assuming the injectivity hypothesis, we can construct an effective upper bound of the hallway 

Important TODO: introduce what `SofaDesigner` does and explain what is it capable of.
