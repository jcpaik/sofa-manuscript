In short, the previous chapters have shown that a sofa is essentially the intersection of rotated hallways. Instead of fixing the hallway $L$ and moving the sofa $S$ inside $L$, we can fix the sofa $S$ and see the movement in the point of view of $S$ so that $L$ is rotating while containing the sofa $S$. So the problem of maximizing the area of a sofa is to maximize the area of the intersection of all such rotating hallways.

The aim of the software `SofaDesigner` is to maximize the intersection of a finite number of hallways $L_1, L_2, \dots, L_n$ rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_n$. 

# Hallway Intersection

This section describes what exactly is a hallway intersection. 
- Representation by $\mathbf{x}_i$
- Representation by $p_i$

The set of all hallway intersections is given by the state $(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n)$, and the set of all states that gives a valid hallway intersection forms a _convex polytope_ inside . That is, a region described by a finite number of inequalities.

# Aims of `SofaDesigner`

We would like to analyze the region where $S$ is at least the area of Gerver's sofa. 

# Combinatorial Arrangement of Hallways

Any intersection or union of polygons are polygons. Moreover, the order of which edges appears in the edges hold importance as well. We denote this as the _combinatorial type_ of ...
